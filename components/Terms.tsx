          By agreeing to the Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you
          may have against Trulyco on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this
          Agreement. This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative
          action against Trulyco, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief
          under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action
          brought against Trulyco by someone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, where you allege claims of violence or crime occurring in
          connection with your use of the site, you may elect to bring those claims in a court of
          competent jurisdiction instead of arbitration. Trulyco agrees to honour your election of
          forum with respect to your crime or violence claim but in so doing does not waive the
          enforceability of this Arbitration clause as to any other provision, controversy, claim or
          dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents you from making a report to or filing a
          claim or charge with an appropriate government agency or seeking other administrative
          remedies.
        </p>
        <p>14.4. Choice of law</p>
        <p>
          The Terms of Use and any Claim will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
          laws of Lagos State and of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, without regard to its conflict
          of law provisions.
        </p>

        <h3>15. Term and Termination</h3>
        <p>
          This agreement will remain effective until terminated by you or terminated by us in
          writing. In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your right to use the site
          Services is automatically revoked. Where you continue to use the site, you will continue
          to be bound by the Terms of Use regardless of any notice of termination.{' '}

        <p>
          After this Agreement terminates, the terms of this Agreement and the other Terms of Use
          that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after this Agreement terminates
          or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect including without limit
          provisions requiring arbitration, protecting intellectual property, indemnification and
          setting forth limitations of liability. Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms
          of Use, the termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you or Trulyco
          from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that thereafter
          may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Terms of Use and all policies and guidelines incorporated by reference, sets forth the
          entire agreement and understanding between you and Trulyco relating to the subject matter
          hereof and thereof and cancels and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions,
          agreements, representations, warranties, and other communications between you and us,

        <p>
          No modification or amendment to the Terms of Use will be binding upon Trulyco unless they
          are agreed in a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of Trulyco
          acting in such capacity or posted on the site by Trulyco.
        </p>
        <p>16.2. Waiver</p>
        <p>
          Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to
          act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. We do not guarantee we will act
          against all breaches of the Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>16.3. Assignments</p>
        <p>
          User may not assign the Terms of Use, or any of its rights or obligations hereunder,
          without Trulyco’s prior written consent in the form of a written instrument signed by a
          duly authorized representative of Trulyco. Trulyco may freely assign this Agreement and
          the other Terms of Use without User’s consent. Waiver

        <p>16.4. Severability</p>
        <p>
          If and to the extent any provision of this Agreement or the other Terms of Use is held
          illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in whole or in part under applicable law or by a Court
          of competent jurisdiction, such provision or such portion thereof will be ineffective as
          to the jurisdiction in which it is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable to the extent of its
          illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability and will be deemed modified to the extent
          necessary to conform to applicable law so as to give the maximum effect to the intent of
          the parties. The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that
          jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such
          provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction. The
          illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the
          legality, validity and enforceability of all other provisions.
        </p>
        <p>16.5. Force Majeure </p>
        <p>
          The parties to this Agreement will not be responsible for the failure to perform, or for

          conditions beyond the reasonable control of such party.
