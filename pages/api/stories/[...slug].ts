A walk in Tokyo is never dull. Day or night, weekday or weekend, there will always be
something that catches the eye. Sitting in an overpass above Shinagawa Station, one of the
metropolis’ key business districts, the men in suits and the women sporting monochromatic
apparel comprise the majority of people swarming through the station. During peak time it
is divided into a one-way system due to the sheer volume of commuters. All of this could
trick you into believing that this is all there is to Japan, the rush hour flow of suits
and ties, but like many things in this country, there is more than meets the eye.The
juxtaposition of Shinagawa with the nearby streets in Shibuya ward, a few stations
clockwise on the Yamanote Line loop, is staggering. A walk through the meandering back
streets of Shibuya, including Harajuku and Omotesando, promises a kaleidoscope of colours,
style and subcultures, each offering insight into the trends that have shaped each area
and generation respectively. Indeed, while a kaleidoscope’s end result is an array of
vibrant colours and patterns, it has symmetry and reflection at its core. The same
composition can be found in Japanese fashion, heavily influenced by American fashion and
moulding it into their own.
</p>
<p>
Japanese fashion brands such as Beams, Journal Standard and United Arrows, defined by
their Oxford shirts, khaki chinos and penny loafers, have developed into staples of every
fashion mall and outlet. At first glance, these may seem like middle-class brands from
across the Pacific. But make no mistake, these are Japanese brands, founded by Japanese
people. Their influences, however, come largely from the “Ivy League” fashion of the
1960s.
</p>
<p>
“Made in Japan” sells, even if it means that those clothes would not look out of place in
downtown San Francisco half a century ago. In marketing the clothes, heavy emphasis is
placed on durability and “Japanese quality.”
</p>
<p>
In the same essence that Ivy League fashion was derived from the aspiring middle class to
wear casual clothes sported by the upper classes, there is a sentiment in Japan that an
outfit from the likes of Beams can transform a person’s appearance and social status.
</p>
<h3>“there is a sentiment in Japan that an outfit from the likes of Beams can transform a person’s appearance
and social status.”</h3>
<p>
Magazines such as POPEYE and JJ rose to prominence in the 1980s, exhibiting the ways of
American life and style to adoring Japanese teenagers. They, in turn, fueled the demand
for the college crewneck sweaters and madras shirts pictured in the magazines, which would
soon become commonplace in the streets of Japan, with domestic brands desperately trying
to imitate the styles depicted in publications, giving birth to the so-called “Japanese
preppy” subculture.
</p>
<p>
There is far more to Japanese fashion than regurgitated western styles, though. While the
Japanese preppy fashion may be deeply rooted in American style, there are plenty of
fashions that Japan can call its own.
</p>
<p>
None more so than the Lolita fashion. With its roots in Harajuku, it is subject to so much
fascination and fetishization from adoring tourists in the area, hoping to catch a glimpse
of that one image that caught their eye in Tokyo guidebook.

        title: 'Like a doll',
        epigraph:
          'The fashion itself is centered around dressing like a doll, and, although its exact origin within Japanese society is debatable, the gothic Visual Kei fashion style exhibited by some bands during the ’80s can be credited in part for the initial rise of the fashion movement. There are certainly hints of nostalgia with Lolita, with adults wearing this doll-like fashion, wanting to be reminded of the freedom of youth, which coincided with the bubble economy era.',

<p>
  The Lolita fashion trend offers, to those embracing it, a kind of escapism. On the
  weekdays, they conform to the norms of a traditional Shinagawa office, but on the
  weekends, they allow themselves to become immersed in a world of fantasy, wearing, along
  with other like-minded individuals, their frilly and gothic dresses. This dual
  personality, offering both freedom and excitement, is one they heartily embrace.
</p>
<p>
  With the Lolita fashion having roots in glam rock and punk rock bands, groups such as Glay
  in the late 1980s and Sugizo in the 1990s were able to export the trend overseas. And,
  with the rise of the internet and the accessibility of music, they helped spread Japanese
  fashion and culture to the world.
</p>
<p>
  While Lolita has been one of Japan’s most notable fashion exports to the world, its roots
  remain firmly planted in Harajuku. The walk from Harajuku station through Takeshita-dori
  remains a sensory overload for those who haven’t done their research on the area, even if
  the shops selling Lolita clothing have been replaced by merchants capitalising on the
  slightly more recent Decora wave of fashion, which aligns more with the stereotypical
  “kawaii” (cute) that Japan is known for.
</p>
<p>
  Although both Lolita and Decora have origins in Harajuku, Decora places more emphasis on
  colourful garments and layers, with items such as leg warmers, arm warmers, tutus and
  knee-length socks forming staples of this luminous subculture. Also, accessories on bags
  and clothing are fairly popular, many pimping their bags with cartoon characters in a
  nostalgic child-like ode.
</p>
<p>
  Takeshita-dori truly reflects the vivid, flamboyant nature of Decora fashion. The
  adjoining streets promote neon garments to cover every inch of the body, as well as
  patterned leggings that could cause nausea if stared at for too long. All of these,
  encapsulated by teens and tourists tackling gigantic rainbow cotton candies larger than
  basketballs, are a perfect portrayal of Harajuku and Decora.
</p>
<p>
  And no one encapsulates the vast spectrum of colours drawn from Harajuku than Dolly. Known
  as “That Rainbow Chick” on Instagram, she certainly lives up to that name with images of
  her dressed, head to toe in radiant, flamboyant clothing in the streets of Harajuku.
  Everything Dolly wears gets the “deco” treatment, from her rainbow hair extensions to her
  bright pink chokers to her brightly-coloured accessories. They are staples for her style,
  as is her customizing baseball bats with Harley Quinn-themed stickers and stamps.
</p>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bN0nHNyx/v2.gif" alt="CHANGE"/>
<p>
Her love for colour is nothing new, but the Decora subculture gave her a sense of
belonging within a fashion community. “As a kid,” Dolly said in an interview, “I wore
mismatched neon shirts and shorts almost every day. The first time I saw photos of
Harajuku Fashion, I was amazed. They used so many colours and accessories. But I didn’t
start dressing in it until high school. I dressed up once for a “crazy spirit day” at
school and realized it was 100% more comfortable than the jeans and T-shirts I had been
wearing. It had an amazing effect, and for the first time in my life I felt confident in
my body and comfortable in my style. I think that speaks to a lot of people.”
</p>
<p>
In the 14 years since she started this journey, she has watched these fashion bombs
explode all over the world. She says, “As the internet got more reliable and widespread,
people like me, who grew up googling Harajuku and looking at poorly scanned photos from
Japanese magazines like FRUiTS and Kera, found communities online where we could share our
experiences and information.
</p>
<p>
“Now, most countries have their own Harajuku Fashion groups or Harajuku Fashion Walks.
People try to say Harajuku is dead—and yes, the streets themselves are a little
different—but now Harajuku is a global phenomenon. Thousands of small shops around the
world have opened to sell Harajuku-inspired clothing and accessories. YouTube is full of
channels about how to dress kawaii. Instagram tags of Harajuku and Harajuku fashions have
hundreds of thousands of posts.
</p>
<h3>“Harajuku to me is a community. It is an area that has been built by small
groups gathering together and creating their own unique and creative space</h3>
<p>
“Harajuku to me is a community. It is an area that has been built by small groups
gathering together and creating their own unique and creative space in a country that
touts such sayings as, ‘The nail that sticks up will be hammered down.’ It is a place to
let go and have fun with yourself and others and explore your own identity.”
</p>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/bN0nHNyx/v2.gif" alt="CHANGE"/>
<p>
If Harajuku has trademarked the kawaii culture through the Decora and Lolita sub-cultures,
then it only takes a brief walk down Meiji-Dori to uncover an entirely different fashion
trend. The heart of Shibuya is home to the Gyaru fashion and subculture.

In addition to the conspicuous nature of their faces, they often opted for bright and
colourful clothing—again, contrasting much of society, who, for the large part, would
dress to conform rather than stand out.

“I’m going to get a visa and travel to Paris to look for work,” my uncle said, with a
smile on his face. “Like you, I want to live in Europe and earn money so I can look after
your cousins and auntie.” There was a flash of a million dreams glimmering in his eyes. I
tried to picture him in Paris, standing in a street corner in the cold October rain,
trying to figure out his next move and how he was so far from everyone he knows and loves.
I imagined him approaching store managers and asking them whether they have any vacancies,
and I thought of the pitying smiles and looks they would probably shoot his way, glancing
at the weather- inappropriate beige bomber jacket he loved so much, and the
slightly-too-big trousers he had bought for 50,000 CFA from a market in Dakar. He’d
carefully packed them in his suitcase and travelled halfway across the world in search of
a better life, diving head-first into the unknown.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t know how to begin explaining the dirty looks of hatred and prejudice and the
disappointment he was likely to be subject to if he moved to Europe. How, for the past
decade, the atmosphere in Europe had grown increasingly hostile towards immigrants, and
how every country seemed to have its own Farage, Le Pen, Salvini, and Orban—with thousands
of people listening to their toxic words, just waiting for a call-to-action. I did not
want him to one day have to hear the callousness behind the words: “There is no more space
here. Europe is full. Go back to Africa instead of coming to free-load over here!” I
didn’t have the heart to tell him how, most likely, he would end up underpaid and
overworked. With little to no career progression options and unsociable working hours,
while struggling to make ends meet. I had no words to explain to him how exhausting and
unnerving it is to always feel like the “other”, and how your body starts to crave being
surrounded by people who look like you and being somewhere you can go incognito once again
and breathe a little easier, instead of feeling like you’re constantly walking under a
magnifying glass, having to be on your best behaviour; constantly proving to white people
that you are not like “the others”—and that you are hardworking and honest, worthy of
living in this country you picked to carve a life out for yourself. Or that even the
Thieboudienne he would find somewhere in the 18th arrondissement would never taste
anything like it does at home.
</p>

<p>
Despite what many white Europeans want us to believe, Black people have always been in
Europe. We are very much here and always will be. When St Maurice, an Egyptian born in AD
250, became the leader of the legendary Roman Theban Legion, I wonder how his troops
received him, and if he was treated as an oddity, whether his skin color was something out
of the ordinary to most people. Despite clear evidence of Africans having a presence in
Europe
</p>
<p>
from the third century onwards, there still exists a notion that African Europeans have
only come here recently. Olivette Otele’s book
<b> African Europeans: An Untold History </b>
delves into the long-spanning and diverse links between the two continents.
</p>
<p>
Just a few weeks ago, an elected politician, mortally offended that I made a distinction
between white Finnish people and Black Finnish people, tweeted at me that I do not need to
specify the skin colour of Finns because Finnish people are always white and that I should
go back to Senegal. There are no official figures of how many people of African heritage
are in Finland because ethnicity is not recorded in national statistics. According to
<b> estimates by Statistics Finland, the figure is around 50,000 Afro-Finns.</b>
</p>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GhdNmjcP/chart.jpg" alt="Chart" />
<p>
Despite consistently topping charts in education, quality of life, and happiness levels,
Finland has also recently taken the pole position as the country where Black people and
Africans experience the most racism. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights’
<b>Being Black in the EU</b> revealed that 63% of people of African descent in Finland
have experienced racial harassment. The figure was considerably higher than in the other
12 countries surveyed in the study. It brings to mind the term “weathering,” a term that
refers to the deterioration of health as a result of long-term stress and the cumulative
effects of being exposed to systemic racism your whole life.
</p>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/rwsz7bPK/being-black-in-eu.jpg" alt="Being black in the EU" />
<p>
Ever since I can remember, I’ve been told to be understanding and patient, because racist
and ignorant people fear what they do not know. To them, I represent a threat so real that
it makes grown men shout slurs at 7-year-old me, and it makes old ladies spit on my brand
new coat as I stand in the street.
</p>
<h3>And so I wait</h3>
<p>
I’ve been waiting. I waited in the ’80s. And the ’90s. Then the 2000s –all the way until
the 2010s. It’s now the 2020s, and I am still waiting, waiting for an end to the
microaggressions that forever remind me I am “other”—from the shopkeeper who addresses me
in English rather than my native Finnish; to the white man quizzing me about my roots, and
not settling for my answer when he asks where I am from, and I reply, “Helsinki.”
</p>
<p>
My phone screen lights up and a Twitter notification pops up as a response to an article I
wrote about inequality and racism in Europe:
</p>
<blockquote>
If you’re so unhappy here, why don’t you f*** off back to Africa.
<br /> <br />
Charming.
</blockquote>
<p>
As James Baldwin said much more eloquently: “What is it that you wanted me to reconcile
myself to? I was born here more than 60 years ago. I’m not going to live another 60 years.
You always told me that it’s going to take time. It’s taken my father’s time, my mother’s
time, my uncle’s time, my brothers’ and my sisters’ time, my nieces’ and my nephews’ time.
How much time do you want for your progress?”
</p>
<p>
In a speech delivered on August 28, 1963, Rep. John Lewis, the American statesman and
civil rights leader who died July 17, 2020, said: “To those who have said, ‘Be patient and
wait,’ we have long said that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually,
but we want to be free now!”
</p>
<p>To be honest, I feel like I have waited long enough. Time’s up.</p>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/J0X530bC/finland-flag.jpg" alt="Finland flag" />
<p>
At the risk of sounding self-serving, I’m often unsure of how to refer to myself, or how I
identify. The quick answer is that I’m Finnish-Senegalese. The long version is that I was
born in Finland, where I lived until I was 8 and moved to Luxembourg and then, a few years
later, to Belgium. And from there, I moved to London, where I have spent the last 14
years. And no, I don’t know where home is. I don’t feel quite Finnish, or quite
Senegalese. And although London has been home, I don’t feel like I belong here either.
Sometimes I wonder if the need to identify as something is for me—or whether I am trying
to make myself more explainable to others.

Depending on the situation and people I am interacting with, my identity changes. When I
am away from Finland, my “Finnishness” is heightened: I cook Finnish food, vibe out to
Finnish songs, and observe Finnish traditions. When I am in Finland, it has almost the
complete opposite effect: I feel like a fish out of water, like a cheap impostor. I used
to say I’m half Finnish and half Senegalese, but as a friend asked, “Which half of you is
which?” Half implies that I am not whole; half means incomplete.
</p>
<p>
Finnish-Senegalese seems like a happy medium that allows me to claim both, without
divvying up any of my body parts.
</p>
<p>
The first record of an African in Finland is from 1875, when the Finnish missionary
brought a girl named Eva Maria Nangurashi, from Ovamboland, modern-day Namibia. However,
it’s reported she did not adapt well to her new “home” and returned to her real home soon
after.
</p>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/q7P2Q0Qs/eva-maria-nangurashi.png" alt="Eva Maria Nangurashi"/>
<p>
A little more is known about Rosa Emilia Lemberg (born Rosa Emilia Clay), the first
African with Finnish citizenship. Rosa was born in the village of Omaruru, in modern-day
Namibia, on August 31, 1875. Despite several attempts to embellish or romanticize the
story of how Rosa came into being, I try not to think too much about the likelihood of the
sickening events that led to Rosa’s creation. Her mother was a young local woman, and her
father was a British man named Charles William Clay. At two months, Rosa was taken from
her mother to live with an English missionary family. I shudder as I read the sentence,
catching myself just in time before I continued to read. I keep thinking if the
missionaries had to snatch Rosa from her mother’s arms, if they took her baby while she
was sleeping or otherwise busy. Did they convince the young mother (and themselves) that
they were acting in good faith–and in the name of God?
</p>
<p>
They probably said to Rosa’s mother: The child will have a great life! She’ll see things
you could never even dream about! We can offer her so much better than this life here,
with you. And as they said these words, I imagine the mother’s heart shattered into a
million little pieces, her arms forever aching for the daughter she would no longer be
able to hold. How long, if ever, did it take for her baby’s cries to stop haunting her
nights?
</p>
<p>
Rosa ended up in a missionary school run by a Finnish couple, Karl and Ida Weikkolin, who
brought her to Finland when she was 13. What did she think or feel when she looked at the
disappearing coastline of her homeland? Did she wipe tears into the corner of her sleeve,
and reassure herself that she would one day return? Did she feel sadness, confusion, fear,
or a mixture of all of these? When she arrived in Finland, a newspaper, Wiipurin Uutiset,
on June 8, 1888, announced the arrival of “a mulatto girl, born and baptized in Africa.”
The term, derived from “little mule” in Spanish, makes me flinch. Did the white Finns gawk
at Rosa as she walked down the street? Did she have to smile politely as they touched her
hair without asking? Did she pretend not to hear the giggling and the laughter behind her
back, and remind herself to just smile and hold her head up high, as she walked?
</p>
<p>
Rosa was sent to school, but during holidays the Weikkolins paraded her and held
performances where Rosa sang songs in an African language she did not know. If she
refused, her adoptive mother, Ida—who described herself as a kind, warm- hearted
benevolent Christian woman in her memoirs—would hit her and treat her like an unpaid maid.
Rosa described her time in Finland with the Weikkolins like this: “Everywhere there were
curious audiences. After all, everyone wanted to see the only Negro in Finland. Everyone
wanted to hear that Negro pray and sing in those strange African tongues. At every event,
the collection brought in a lot of money—magnificent amounts, in fact. But I never got as
much as five pennies to put towards buying sweets... Many a time during the first weeks I
spent in Finland, I would sob and wish that I were still in Ovamboland with my own tribe.”
</p>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/0Q6c6CnV/rosa-emilia-clay.png" alt="Rosa Emilia Clay" />
<p>Rosa graduated in 1889 and received Finnish citizenship on September 1, 1899.</p>
<p>
She worked as a teacher but often considered moving away. She fell in love, but her
fiancé, a Russian doctor, killed himself (said to have been due to a suspected psychotic
episode resulting from the drugs he had experimented on himself with) shortly before they
were to marry. And Rosa, devastated and possibly re-evaluating her entire life, left
Finland in 1904. When she arrived in New York, she did not speak any English. She sought
the company of Finns living there. At first, they were suspicious of her and did not
accept her. But when they realized she spoke perfect Finnish, they welcomed her into their
community. Rosa became a well-liked and respected member of the Finnish-American
community. She was a choir leader, an actress, singer, teacher and director. She got
married and had two children, Irja and Orvo, and raised them as a single mother after
divorcing her husband soon after the birth of her son. She worked tirelessly and was able
to fund acting and singing classes for her children who performed at Chicago’s Imperial
Hall on many occasions. Rosa died in 1959 in a Finnish care home in a small town in
Illinois.
</p>
<p>
I am not related to Rosa Clay (heck, I’m not even from Namibia!), yet, the more I read
about her, the more connected I feel to her. So much of Rosa’s story feels similar to
mine. I understand the spitting, the whispering and the constant reminders that you are
the “other.” I know the looks and the stares, the prodding and the poking—like that time
my friend’s grandmother asked to see the palms of my hands and soles of my feet, how she
asked me to take my socks off so she could take a proper look (and how I obliged because
my 7-year-old self did not know that I could say, “No, you weird old stranger lady!”). So
I took my socks off—despite the fact that this bizarre intrusion was interrupting a game
of Hungry Hippos I was playing with my friends—and let her gasp with amazement at the
paleness of my hands and feet. “My goodness! I’ve never seen you people up close! How
strange… so strange... Fascinating.” I felt like I wanted the freshly polished parquet
floor underneath my now bare feet to open up and swallow me, without really understanding
why I felt the way I did.
</p>
<p>
I know the hyper-visibility and hyper-awareness that comes from existing as a Black person
in Europe, like constantly walking under a microscope, but at the same time feeling
forever invisible, as our existence here is often questioned or denied. Rosa Clay has
become proof that we are just as entitled to claim Finnishness as our identity: “See! She
looks like me, and she lived here a hundred years before me!” Poor Rosa. What would she
think if she knew she was being used as a token? What would she feel if she knew that, in
so many ways, very little has changed for Africans in Europe in one century?
</p>
<p>
I had to see if I could find any more information about what happened to Rosa Lemberg’s
lineage, if her story had a happy ending. So I tracked down Rosa’s
great-great-granddaughter, AnnaLee Jacobs, a white woman living near Chicago.
</p>
<blockquote>
“My grandmother Normalee, daughter of Irja Lemberg, was born in 1928. We know that Irja
had been so severely bullied as a child because of her dark skin, that she kept her
mother’s African heritage a secret until her death. We had no idea about our African
ancestry until after she died. I always remember her wearing hats and long sleeves in the
summer when we played in her garden—and now it makes sense why she did it: she wanted to
keep her skin as fair as possible. We subsequently found out that, when Irja gave birth to
my grandmother Normalee, she was so shocked by her baby’s dark skin tone that she
attempted to kill herself and her newborn baby. I cannot even imagine the awful things
that she must have lived through for her to feel tormented to that point. It was a
confusing time for us, all of us trying to piece together the puzzle and uncover the side
of the family that had been hidden from us. Perhaps strangely, our family has always
embraced the Swedish side of our heritage and traditions—even to the extreme. At family
dinners, we would eat Nordic delicacies, like lingonberry jam, and my grandmother was
known for cooking traditional Swedish lutefisk–dried whitefish, pickled in lye—for our
Christmas Eve dinner. I’m ashamed and embarrassed that my family felt they had to hide
their Black heritage. And I feel terrible about the things that Rosa must have gone
through: to grow up being treated like an oddity and being forced to perform and sing like
a circus freak. It’s interesting to me that Rosa managed to build a home within the
Finnish community in Chicago—but that Irja was so severely ridiculed… I find it
interesting that Rosa never returned to Europe or Africa. If Rosa were here now, I would
ask her how she managed to achieve so much and be so well-respected within the community,
as a single mother of two young children, during The Great Depression. She sounds like a
pretty remarkable woman.”
</blockquote>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/brV6dBcV/rosa-emilia-clay-2.png" alt="Rosa Clay" />
<p>
Yet again, Rosa’s story probably seems familiar to many Black and brown people living in
majority-white countries, going out of our way to do a million things at once, and
overachieving in everything we set out to do, constantly attempting to prove our worth,
resilience and resourcefulness. We are not allowed to be average—or, God forbid, mediocre.
We have to prove our value, venturing uncomfortably but seamlessly into respectability
politics, and showing we are able to make a valuable contribution to this capitalist
society of ours. I have to often remind myself that we are allowed to just be.
</p>
<p>
African and European are still often considered as two separate categories, but surely the
concept is now too limiting in our ever-changing world and increasing ethnic diversity.
Can we really not inhabit two spaces at once? Do I have to pick myself apart, and choose
which I align myself with more? The term “Afropean,” popularized by Belgian-Congolese
singer Marie Daulne, is used to refer to mixed race people with African heritage, or
members of the African diaspora living in Europe. I like the term because it creates a
hybrid, removing the Senegalese- Finnish dichotomy I so often feel stuck in. It allows me
to be whole, and to exist in both spaces at once.
</p>
<p>
In his book Afropean: Notes from Black Europe, author and photographer Johny Pitts
documents his travels across the continent, meeting people of African heritage along his
way. He says the term helped him to think of himself as “unhyphenated.” That’s what I
crave, too. But, much like the term <b>“Third Culture Kid,”</b> which refers to children who have
spent the majority of their lives in a culture other than their own, Afropean has
unsavoury connotations of elitism, and seems to be applied to mostly light-skinned African
Europeans with university degrees and passports that give them access to most countries
around the globe. Pitts acknowledges this privilege, and also questions who the term
applies to.

Sometimes, I cringe at a version of myself from five years ago, who had idealistic views
of a globalized earth with mixed-heritage people populating the earth. Now, I am aware of
the privilege and problematic connotations attached to that ideal. It reminds me of the
irksome <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2013/10/changing-face-america/" target="_blank"><b>National Geographic article </b></a>
that hailed the future face of America as beige. Since having children, I have become
unpleasantly accustomed to the fetishizing of mixed-heritage children that seems to be
commonplace. I feel like all this plays directly into the hands of white supremacy and the
erasure of Blackness. Throughout history, white people have attempted to weed out
Blackness—and I feel like “we will all be mixed-race one day!” is just another step
towards that: Black is not accepted, but light-skinned people with Eurocentric features
are preferable and palatable.
</p>
<p>
Senghor had visions of cultural métissage: the cultural mixing of society. He would advise
his compatriots to “assimilate in order to not be assimilated,” but believed this can only
happen once Africans have a thorough understanding of their roots and history, and only
once African identity is situated in a literary tradition. Only then will the playing
field be even, and Africans can begin to participate on the global stage with all other
cultures, and selectively incorporate ideas and parts of different cultures into their
society. I feel like we are a long way from being able to do that. You cannot reform a
system built on injustice and equality; you have to dismantle it and build up something
entirely new.
</p>
<p>
It seems that all around Europe there is a deep-seated reluctance and denial of any past
wrongdoings. Any mention of these evils of the past is quickly met with “whataboutery.”
Things are bubbling under the surface, with separatist movements and referendums
increasingly gaining traction (Scotland and Catalan, and the potential crumbling of the
United Kingdom following Britain’s exit from the European Union). Perhaps the time has
come to reassess nation-states, and whether they are fit for purpose.
</p>
<p>
I have grown more aware of how borders are used to distinguish between “us” and “them,”
and instill in us a sense that we are somehow more worthy than others. We have managed to
convince ourselves that we are entitled and deserving of what we have. Being able to enjoy
freedom of movement across the European Union and feeling that others are not as
deserving, simply because our legal system has been built in a way that denies these same
rights to others.
</p>
<p>
With the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become evident that countries are using borders to shut
out asylum seekers, and hiding under the cloak of distraction provided by the global
crisis. While we have been cocooned in our homes, some European states have been busy
hardening their stance on border control and immigration. While we have been taking to the
streets in our thousands, crying and proclaiming that “Black Lives Matter!” and white
people have been perfecting their performative allyship for a hashtag that quickly went
silent, Black and brown people have been drowning in the Mediterranean and in the English
Channel, and no one seems to bat an eyelid. European states regularly <a href="https://twitter.com/MVLouiseMichel/status/1300084870991888384?s=20" target="_blank"><b>ignore Mayday calls</b></a>
from rescue boats trawling the seas in search of survivors despite their obligation under
international maritime law to rescue every person in danger at sea, regardless of
nationality or legal status. The ones who survive the crossing are placed in detention
centres and camps with <a href="https://twitter.com/MVLouiseMichel/status/1300084870991888384?s=20" target="_blank"><b>inhumane living conditions. </b></a> 
Setting aside the nuances of international laws, basic humanity and common decency should 
be the driving forces behind our actions.
</p>

<p>
As of October 26, 2020, there have been 728 migrant deaths recorded on the Mediterranean
this year, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.
</p>
<p>But Black lives matter, right? Well, just not these, then.</p>
<p>
The lucky ones are those who get picked up, who only have minor fuel burns and
dehydration. The unlucky ones are those forever sleeping on the sea bed, never to be
found, never to be searched for; their friends and families left wondering if by some
miracle or other divine intervention, their loved one managed to make it ashore. And then,
after countless desperate prayers whispered into the wee hours of the night towards the
heavens, and months spent waiting for the phone to ring, or a letter to arrive, only to
admit defeat, eventually succumbing to heartbreak, and bracing themselves for the next
family member or friend to decide if they might be lucky enough to make it and be able to
build a new life or home somewhere else.
</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>
At the moment, for me, home is nowhere. I exist in-between, as I have just uprooted my
family and moved to my country of birth, where I have not lived for nearly a quarter of a
century. The <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brexit-pandemic_uk_5f3684b8c5b69fa9e2fa517f?amp&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKOQc7J3IjV-JJ1BASKLvvET82J9180m1V4L7MKsIyV75-hwwztvvJBgfMLyN8oC08tTHM-3cSNY3dAQcH5wT7WCPm6PuePVO3xHDCKg-S6nGJ_5V-6xc62RmKhlM0NHh3YCt0_rnsblpvxNreFiJS70QhyyuMnXhqDbMDa4G4s3&_guc_consent_skip=1604498324" target="_blank"><b>political situation</b></a> in the United Kingdom necessitated our move, and the main
advantages of a move to Finland are its affordable childcare and proximity to the sea and
to nature. I am terrified and excited and unsure of how I will adjust and cope with the
transition of moving back to Finland. At the moment, living in Europe feels like my entire
house is on fire, and I am unsure of what to save first. A never-ending game of whack-a-
mole where a new problem crops up as soon as one is fixed. I feel disconnected,
desperately trying to find some steady ground to bury my feet in, so I can draw a deep
breath for the first time in what feels like months, if not years.

<p>
In her 2005 essay about Afropolitanism, <a href="http://thelip.robertsharp.co.uk/?p=76" target="_blank"><b>“Bye-Bye Babar,”</b></a> author Taiye Selasi asserts that
figuring out one’s identity is an enriching experience, as it helps us expand perspectives
on “nation and selfhood.” She writes about the multi- dimensionality and complexity of
what it means to be African. She argues that the identity of Afropolitans is
three-dimensional: national, cultural and racial. I hope I find this inner equilibrium
soon.

  “Home is where I feel at peace. It’s where my friends are, and where I feel safe. It’s
  where I’m able to take up physical and political space, and can live free of the fear of
  microaggressions,” says Adéọlá Naomi Adérèmí, a Greek-Nigerian living in Belgium, and
  founder of <a href="http://www.distinguisheddiva.com/" target="_blank"><b>Distinguished Diva</b></a>, a multi-disciplinary online collective and platform for
  women of African heritage across the globe. “People move around the world; they always
  have. They shift and evolve. To me, “belonging” is all about what and who I am when I move
  away from where I feel at home. Despite not having a Ghanaian heritage, I instantly feel
  at home when I walk the streets of Accra. The sounds, the smells, and the sights instantly
  feel familiar,” she says.
</p>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/85VGpwhV/finding-rest.png" alt="finding rest"/>
<p>
Adéọlá has never felt disconnected from her “Africanness,” as her Yoruba heritage is
evident in her family life. When I ask her this question, I wonder if she pities me a
little, as I project my own—hopefully short-lived—identity crisis on her. She grew up
listening to her grandmother’s stories, and attributes a large part of why she is so in
touch with her African identity despite living in Europe to the fact she speaks several
languages. “I feel very west African,” she says. “I speak Yoruba and Hausa, as well as
English, Greek, and French, which opens up a lot of opportunities, and I can comfortably
travel around Africa. Where I belong and where I feel a sense of allegiance to are not
about nation-states or borders for me. But I must say and acknowledge the fact that this
is a very privileged way of looking at identity and nationality. Many people on this
planet do not have the option to choose between multiple countries and identities, and
many are not able to move between countries as freely as I am.”
</p>
<p>
I can relate to the importance of language in ensuring a strong connection with one's
roots. I do not speak my father’s language, Seereer, and it serves as a constant reminder
of my inadequacies as a bona fide Senegalese. My father can be considered somewhat of a
pioneer of the Seereer Language: he has dedicated roughly 20 years to translating Léopold
Sédar Senghor’s poems from French to Seereer, their shared native language. Besides
translating Senghor’s poems, he has just published a three-volume essay series analyzing
and explaining the poems in detail. He hopes students will be able to use the material to
better connect with Senghor’s work. But as long as students in Senegal are primarily
educated in French and English, their relationship with their heritage will remain
fragile.
</p>
<p>
I feel like I should rest. I feel as though I have been stuck in the capitalist, white-
supremacist grind culture, where productivity is put above mental and physical wellbeing.
Resting means retaliating. Putting my needs before theirs. I ask Adéọlá if she has any
tips for me, for grounding myself. “My grandmother always used to say that the sun, sea,
and salt can fix everything. I find all of those things through nature and food. Since my
grandmother died, I have reclaimed my relationship with nature. Capitalism has destroyed
the close relationship we used to have with the earth; natural resources have been
violated, and we have lost a large part of our heritage. Reclaiming nature, and doing
ancestral work and divination is what helps me feel grounded. Often, it’s also a good idea
to learn about the indigenous cultures of wherever you are, as they are often the people
with the deepest connection to the land you are living on,” she says. That makes sense to
me.
</p>
<p>
The Sámi are the only indigenous people of the European Union, and the total Sámi
population is estimated to be over 75,000, with the majority living in Norway. In Finland,
there are about 10,000 Sámi.
</p>
<p>
They have been subjected to awful treatment by the Finnish government, from humiliating
skull measurements to forced assimilation, where, until the 1970s, Sámi children were
forcibly taken from their families and schooled in strict boarding houses, where speaking
their native language was prohibited. Despite this, the Sámi have managed to pass their
languages and other cultural heritage to future generations, and there has been greater
visibility and promotion of Sámi culture in Finland. But there is still a long way to go,
as many white Finns simply fail to acknowledge the Finnish government’s role as a
colonizer. Finland has yet to ratify the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989
(No. 169), which protects the rights of indigenous people in the country, for more than 30
years. We are no closer to ending the gridlock.
</p>
<p>
In my tireless quest to decolonize my mind and decenter whiteness, I turn my attention to
afro-centrist theories. I enjoy the utopian ideas of borderlessness and pan-Africanism.
Among all the chaos, this seems like a good place to rest for a while. A place where I can
dream of unity and revel in the idea of a shared history, and the idea that the destinies
of all the people of Africa and its diaspora are connected. To read what others have
already said about the world, and learn from the works of elders who led the way, and
whose words are still painfully pertinent today. But I still feel we need to keep our eyes
firmly ahead, and create a new future for ourselves, rather than lean too much on the
past.
</p>

<p>
I speak to Minna Salami, author, speaker and founder of <a href="https://www.msafropolitan.com/" target="_blank"><b>Ms Afropolitan.com</b></a> to see if she
has advice on how to bridge the gap between our past and our future. In her
recently-published book <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/sensuous-knowledge-minna-salami?variant=32206398160930" target="_blank"><b>Sensuous Knowledge: A Black Feminist Approach for Everyone</b></a>, she
coins the concept of <a href="https://www.whatisemerging.com/opinions/exousiance-a-black-feminist-vision-of-power-and-nature-7c08ddb2-d336-4885-add4-be8aca6a376e" target="_blank"><b>Exousiance</b></a>, which looks at power, its connection and co-existence
with the non-human natural world, feminist theory and social criticism. “Connecting the
past, present and future is precisely what we should be doing. No one discourse or theory
is more useful than another. The times we live in are incredibly complex, and what we need
is a hybrid, a mish-mash, an interweaving, and a synthesizing of all of these different
ideological framings including, of course, feminism. This, too, should not be one type of
feminism. We need to draw from Black feminism, from African feminism, from radical
feminism. The best ideas and most useful stories are those that adopt a complex approach
to these issues, drawing insight from art and from the natural world.”
</p>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/63dMKfhg/sensuous-knowledge.png" alt="sensuous knowledge" />
<p>
Perhaps the move to Finland is precisely what my body and mind need at this moment. I try
to draw peace from the fact I now live in a place where I am surrounded by nature. On the
first day we arrived, I stood in the middle of the forest, surrounded only by trees, with
the sound of thousands of pine needles swaying in the autumn breeze, almost as if they
were shushing me to soothe my weary soul. I breathed deeply for what felt like the first
time in months. Being here, in a place where I rest in the peace of things which precede
me and which will remain long after I am gone, I believe I can start finding myself again.
Whether it is the baobabs overlooking my paternal ancestral village in Senegal or this
pine forest next door to my new home, trees seem like the logical things to ground myself
with. In their presence, I become more fully aware of the power that lies within me, my
unapologetic joy; the greatest threat to racists and xenophobes. I am determined to find
and reclaim this even more.
</p>
<p>
For now, I have to retain a little bit of hope as everything around me seems bleak. I look
at the next generation, and hope their upbringing will be different from my generation’s.
I keep seeing calls for more diversity and tolerance, but I hate that word. “Tolerance”
implies you accept something, even though you disagree with it. I hope the next generation
can lean on their ancestors to remind them of where they came from. I hope they, in the
future, can rely on them to point which way to go. I hope these children will be raised to
be troublemakers that simply refuse to accept the status quo.
</p>
<p>
Divisions within physical spaces, geographical borders, and socio-economic lines have
become commonplace. Migration has become the fuel that fires far-right politics across the
European continent. Consequently, indifference to the injustices faced by migrants and
asylum seekers have become the norm to Europeans. At times, it feels like there is no hope
left on this continent. I think of my uncle, sitting on a stool on his porch, sipping on
some attaya under a big mango tree, and going to bed dreaming of Europe as a place with
endless possibilities. I think of Rosa Clay, who, when she began to understand that Europe
was not for her, sought out the Finnish community in America—the only thing which, since
her crossing the ocean, brought her a measure of peace. Perhaps, like her, we are all just
floating; forever searching for a place where our souls can find rest.

  Like Ìfẹ, I wasn’t born into Christianity. My mother, a single parent, was agnostic (at best),
  although she swung towards the wilder side of Christianity at some point in her journey.
</p>
<p>
  Mother herself was a wild woman who danced at the edge of respectability, she still is, fiercely
  independent, a risk-taker even in old age. In hindsight she would have stuck out, a red flag in
  the “boring respectability” of “orthodox” churches. She found the the holier-than-thou and
  aspirational culture of pentecostalism tacky, so it only made sense that her fears and anxieties
  found home in the Aládǔrà Church (aka Cherubim and Seraphim church, aka Kérúbù àti Séráfù). For
  the Aládǔrà walk the thin line between Christianity and African spirituality, they were the less
  than perfect sibling, the black sheep of Nigerian Christianity.
</p>
<p>
  The downside of her new-found faith was that she dragged me along with her, a bewildered teenager
  who couldn’t understand what had come over her mother. Nevertheless, we enthusiastically threw
  ourselves into the dances, the trances, the rituals... until my mother decided she’d had enough.
  Now in her late seventies, mother has settled back into being agnostic, at best, leaving me to
  find a language to describe my empty parts, leaving me to find my missing selves and lead them
  home.

<p>
  At some point in my journey, I found myself in a pentecostal church, and once again threw myself
  into the very heart of it, participating in choir politics, the almost daily ritual of church
  attendance, and the performance of perfection and holiness.
</p>
<p>
  A lack of rigorous engagement with the bible, the deifying of pastors, sexual harassment,
  classism, sexism, discrimination, bigotry, and strangely, racism, were hallmarks of my time in
  church.
</p>
<p>
  When a pastor I considered a friend attempted to rape me and I reported to the “elders,” the
  church rose against me, I didn’t back down until I got some form of justice.
</p>
<p>
  In hindsight, the reason I never fitted in was because the core of me rebelled at the idea of
  worshipping in a temple whose books and rituals erases and shrinks every part of me – woman,
  black, queer, Yorùbá.

<h5>ONE SUNDAY MORNING, I SIMPLY STOPPED</h5>
<p>
  Unlike Ìfẹ Franklin and I, Ifáwẹ̀mímọ́ Omítọ̀nádé was never lost. From childhood she has been
  immersed in the language and traditions of Ifá and Òòṣà. The confidence and power that comes with
  being raised fully conscious of the selves and the different ways they can manifest shows in the
  way she uses social media as a tool to talk about Ifá, <b>Olódùmarè</b>, <b>Irúnmọlè</b>, and
  <b>Òrìṣà</b>, in a country where religious bigotry is rife and people are denied opportunities and
  even have violence visited upon them, for daring to be different. A country where, as recently as
  2018, a woman was killed for professing her Christianity in a Muslim-dominated neighbourhood of
  the nation’s capital and nothing happened to the perpetrators.
</p>
<p>
  Even those who profess atheism or agnosticism still operate within the limits of these
  patriarchal, misogynist, anti-black and homophobic religions, because it is embedded in their
  language, in their way of seeing and dealing with the world. Like Ìfẹ Franklin said during our
  conversation, “religion looms over you” whether you buy into it or not. Religion has shaped the
  language of science, of power, and race relations.

<p>
  In 1850, as part of the long term project of colonisation and sequestering of Africa’s land masses
  for exploitation by capitalist states, Samuel Àjàyí Crowther translated the Book of Romans into
  Yorùbá, and in the process made two major adoptions – Olódùmarè / Ọlọ́ ọ̀run, the names of the being
  revered by the Yorùbá as the progenitor of their race, was changed to god. Èṣù, the one that
  ensures smooth communication between Olódùmarè on one hand, and Irunmole, Òòsà and the Odùduwà
  race on the other, was cast as god’s enemy, Satan.
</p>
<img

  alt="Trauma, disconnect, language and journeying home to selves"
/>
<p><i>Yoruba linguist and the first African Anglican bishop in Nigeria. Born in Osoogun</i></p>
<p>
  In one fell swoop, Samuel Àjàyí Crowther began the erasure of the histories of Ifá and the
  demonisation of blackness. For in the bible, Satan is described as the king of darkness and
  everything evil, while God, an omnipresent, omnipotent being, is the king of light. Ergo, black is
  the colour of sin and evil, black is wrong. White is the colour of truth and good, white is right.
</p>
<p>
  In 1850, Samuel Àjàyí Crowther sowed the first seeds of anti-blackness in the minds of Yorùbá
  people, a seed that has taken root and flourished for nearly two centuries. In 2016, against the
  backdrop of Christian/Islamic fundamentalism and the demonisation of anything associated with
  blackness or ancestor reverence, Ifáwẹ̀mímọ́ took to social media and made a simple but important
  statement: “Èṣù is not Satan.” These three harmless words brought a tidal wave of hate speeches,
  death threats and cyberbullying for the then 20-year-old, who was able to withstand the trolling
  because she knows her selves, and can trace her histories back to pre-slavery, pre-colonial times.
</p>
<p>
  The upside of her bravery is the opening of the floodgates, Ifáwẹ̀mímọ́ gathered a large following
  of those who had been too scared to publicly state their interest in the ancestors, people who had
  been practising Ifá privately and had seen no reason to make their beliefs public. The curious and
  even some rabid fundamentalists. Together, these voices are pushing people to question their
  beliefs in minute, but important ways, a reclamation of Yorùbá is happening.

<blockquote>
  This religion, this practise, connects me, it is everything, it is the root. It doesn’t just
  connect me to my roots, it is the root, it is everything. Ifá lives in us, all the indigenous
  religions of Africa live in all Africans in the diaspora. It’s in our blood, it’s in our DNA, it’s
  in the inflections that we speak, our laughter, the way we tell stories. It permeates everything
  in my life. And once I became, over time, more still, more quiet, more focused, things just
  started opening up to me. And you know, once you start learning things about yourself, even if you
  have your toe in the waters of Ifá, you know, you don’t put your whole body in, you’re connected,
  because your ancestors are there, the Eégún, they are there and they are alive and a lot of times
  people would say, “Oh Ife, you’re so special, oh the way they talk to you, oh…” and I’m like they
  will talk to you too, you are special. There’s nothing about me or that is radiating from me that
  does not radiate from you and everyone else <br />– Ìfẹ Franklin
</blockquote>
<p>
  In Ìbàdàn, the city where I’ve lived for most of my life, there is an Oríta or Bodè in every
  neighbourhood. Oríta is the crossroads where Èṣù dwells. Bodè is slightly different, it is the
  point where the physical and the immaterial meet. They are the borders where Èṣù collects toll
  from beings trying to cross from one reality to another.
</p>
<p>
  One of the many hats Èṣù wears is that of the comptroller of both the crossroads and Bodè. At
  every Bodè and Oríta is a market-place, Èṣù is the comptroller of marketplaces, Ajé is the root of
  commerce.
</p>
<p>
  But I didn’t come to this knowledge until I started journeying to retrieve the lost parts of me.
  Parts I didn’t even know that were missing. There was just this empty hole that pain gnawed at me
  continuously, a hole the church promised would be filled by the “holy spirit” but only grew wider,
  more painful the longer I stayed in the church.
</p>
<p>
  How was I to know that it was my DNA, demanding that I reclaim my identities instead of hiding
  from them? Of pretending that I’m not traumatised by living in a world that is violent towards me
  simply because of my perceived gender and enforced sexual orientation? How was I to know that
  through miseducation, grooming and a healthy dose of whitewashing, I’d been taught that everything
  about me was wrong? The colour of my skin, the manner in which I see the world, the heavy Yorùbá
  accent in my speech, the manner in which I carry my body. My inability to fit into the boxes the
  society insists on forcing me into; a universe being asked to shrink into a sugar carton.
</p>
<p>
  Like every child who grew up in Yorùbá states, I know about the ẹbọ, offerings placed at the
  crossroads where three roads meet. I had been groomed to see them as evil, something to be avoided
  especially early in the mornings, for seeing the offering was deemed a foreshadowing of evil.
  Seeing ẹbọ somehow made you a partaker of the “evil” whoever had placed the offering there meant.
</p>
<p>
  To underline the insidiousness of the demonisation and erasure of our ways and language, my
  mother, when she was growing up in the forties and sixties, also encountered ẹbọ, but back then
  they weren’t seen as evil. In fact mother told me that she and her friends used to look forward to
  these offerings on their way to school because they usually contained edibles (mostly boiled eggs,
  fruits and ẹ̀kọ) and money. The food and offerings were shared amongst those who left home without
  breakfast or money for lunch break.
</p>
<p>
  Looking back at this person that I had been, who, in spite of the fact that I wasn’t raised in a
  religious household, associated everything that wasn’t done in a church or a mosque with evil,
  gives me an insight into how disconnected we, as a people, are from our roots. Without our roots
  we are left adrift in a world that’s cruel to itself and moreso to people with skin the color of
  rich loam.
</p>
<p>
  The first time I met Ìyálọ́ jà Bodè, I’d gone to one of the numerous Bodè markets in Ìbàdàn. I
  needed to buy beads to make myself and some friends anklets and waistbeads. But that was not my
  first time in Bodè, Òópó-Yéọsà, I’d been there to visit friends, to buy natural beauty products
  and in recent years to participate in the Yemọja Festival. But it wasn’t until my third meeting
  with Ìyálọ́ jà, a sprightly woman in her early eighties dedicated to ease and enjoyment, that the
  significance of the neighbourhood became part of my increasing knowledge of my selves, Ifá and the
  histories of the Yorùbá Nations.
</p>
<p>
  It was in that crowded market-place that she sold to me beads cut out of rare stones, and in the
  stringing of these stones together, she whispered words so sacred and powerful I still haven’t
  been able to grasp their entirety, for to translate them into English is to lose their meaning,
  their significance in my life’s journey.
</p>
<p>
  Ìyálọ́ jà, like Ifáwẹ̀mímọ́ , did not come to Ifá pathways late. She came into it as a child who
  learnt the ways of leaves, barks and mushrooms at the foot of her mother, who learnt pharmacology
  from her own mother, who learnt pharmacology from her own mother. Ìyálọ́ jà can trace her roots
  back to pre-colonial times. In one afternoon and a few short sentences, she traced her roots
  beyond Ibadan and could tell you the histories of how Ìbàdàn became a city-state in 1821. Her
  ancestors came with the first wave of settlers, mostly warriors, and established Bodè as the
  centre for healing and documentation of knowledge about healing.
</p>
<p>
  In the face of the violent nature of Ìbàdàn’s transition from a war camp to a city-state and then
  to its present form as the capital of Ọ̀ yọ́ State, the changes brought about by the slave-taking
  wars, the losses suffered by her family. In the face of colonialism and “education" and the many
  ways in which it erased our histories and with it our very nature and self-esteem, her family
  steadfastly passed on knowledge of healing and commerce to their descendants.
</p>
<p>
  The more traumatised her family was by all these historical occurrences, the more they folded into
  their selves, and this folding can still be seen in the manner the original neighbourhoods of
  Ibadan are built so closely, so intimately, defensively, in concentric circles.
</p>
<p>
  Through all these, Ìyálọ́ jà’s family, in order to keep their ancient knowledge and practices
  sacred, had to negotiate their survival – they became Muslims. They started out by sending their
  children to missionary schools and then when compelled, sent them to Islamic schools. In the
  process of negotiating, they lost most of their descendants to modernism, and the Abrahamic
  religions. Some chose to stay, some who were lost, returned.
</p>
<p>
  One of the very few who chose to stay, learn and teach is Ìyálọ́ jà. A woman who is powerful and
  vulnerable to the same degree. A woman who has had to make a lot of sacrifices to maintain her
  independence and to rise to become one of the most powerful women with authority in Ìbàdàn.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to state that Bodè is presently one of the largest markets in the southwest of
  Nigeria dedicated to the sale and documentation of herbs. In the market are also Oníṣègùn, mostly
  women, who use natural remedies to cure common ailments. There are also researchers in this
  market, those who have been expanding the uses of these herbal remedies to accommodate more
  illnesses.
</p>
<p>
  According to Ìyálọ́ jà, the point of using these natural remedies is not primarily to “cure”
  illnesses, but to protect their users even after they are well. The point of healing is not just
  wellness, but wholeness.

<blockquote>
  I always wonder if the people on the continent think about slavery, think about enslavement…
  <br />– Ìfẹ Franklin
</blockquote>
<p>
  My uncle, Rasaki, joined the army at the cusp of the Biafran War in his late teens. He was a
  stubborn young man set in his ways, he wanted adventures, wanted to see the world. Uncle Rasaki
  was a brilliant young man who, in spite of passing out of secondary school with flying colours,
  refused to apply to any university, instead he joined the army against his parents’ wishes.
</p>
<p>
  Before Uncle Rasaki joined the army, my grandmother, Amuda, had divorced my grandfather and moved
  from Lagos to Ìbàdàn to set up her catering business.
</p>
<p>
  She told me of the last day she’d seen him, looking so good in his army uniform. He was much
  calmer, more self-possessed, a total opposite of the wild thing that gave hell to his parents when
  he became a teenager. She told me that on that day, she begged him to reconsider his decision,
  that it wasn’t too late. She’d been hearing rumours of war; the southeast had seceded under the
  leadership of Colonel Ojukwu and she’d also been told that the Aburi Accord had failed, and the
  likelihood of a war loomed in the horizon.
</p>
<p>
  My uncle had laughed her fears off and told her that there was no way the Nigerian government
  would wage war on its own citizens, the Igbo wanted nothing more than to leave and that shouldn’t
  be so difficult?
</p>
<h5>HE WAS WRONG, MY GRANDMOTHER WAS RIGHT.</h5>
<p>
  By June of 1967, the Nigerian government had indeed started killing its own people, and before
  December of the same year, my uncle had been shipped out to the East, to fight in a war he didn’t
  have a hand in starting.
</p>
<p>
  The last my grandmother heard from him was a postcard he sent her from an undisclosed location in
  the east, in which he reassured her that he was fine and should be home soon. The last she heard
  of him was a short message from the army informing her that her son had gone missing in action.
</p>
<p>
  The Yorùbá have a saying that encompasses the trauma of losing a loved one: “ọmọ ẹni kú sàn jù ọmọ
  ẹni nù lọ.” To translate this saying into the English Language is to lose its essence but I can
  attempt to put it into context with another saying: “ó f’ikú s’àgbà.”The Yorùbá do not believe in
  death as the final destination. Death is the pathway to other planes, other realities and
  existences. After death, a person can transit to Àjùlé Ọ̀ run where no one has ever been to and
  returned from, the person can become an ancestor, the impartial carer for the future generations
  of a particular lineage as long as they keep them in remembrance. Death can even be a passport to
  a new existence on earth, in this case the dead simply transits from one part of the world to
  another, Àkúdàáyà. Death in some cases leads to reincarnation, especially if the person was deeply
  loved. My mother, for example, is the reincarnation of my great-great-grandmother (on my
  grandfather’s side) who died around the time my mother was born.
</p>
<img src="/images/temp/lost-in-translation/img-04.jpg" alt="Wellness ≠ Wholeness" />
<p>
  When a child or a young person dies, the Yorùbá believe that death has made this young person an
  elder, an ancestor, “ó f’ikú s’àgbà.” And when someone dies, proper rites are carried out, not
  just to ease the transit of the person from one plane to another, but this process also allows the
  family to mourn the deceased and get some form of closure.
</p>
<p>But when one’s child goes missing, how does the family mourn? How do they gain closure?</p>
<p>
  My grandmother never got closure from the loss of her child, neither did my grandad, or my mother,
  or her siblings who remember Uncle Rasaki as a super-fun elder brother who strapped them to his
  back when they were babies, and cared for them as they grew into young adults. A carefree
  adventurous story-teller. My family never healed, and until her death, my grandmother never
  stopped hoping that her son would return home, for “ọmọ ẹní kú, sàn ju ọmọ ẹni nù lọ.”
</p>
<p>
  Till her death, my grandmother was as healthy and as sprite as it was possible for a woman her
  age, but till her death, she was never whole, for a large chunk of her heart wandered the face of
  the earth seeking the child that didn’t return home from a war he didn’t start.
</p>
<blockquote>
  You want me to tell you about slavery? That’s a loaded one…One of the things I would tell you is
  that no one has ever asked me personally about the slavery before, no one… <br />– Ìfẹ Franklin
</blockquote>
<p>
  Around 1525, a couple of sailors from an European country “press ganged” some “natives” from the
  “West Coast” of “Africa” into working on their ships. On discovering how “strong” and “hard
  working” these enslaved people were, they decided to go back for more “natives.” Within a few
  years, these European sailors would raid small coastal villages, killing the most vulnerable and
  those who fought back, enslaving the rest. The next step was wooing malcontents with gold, and
  with their aid, mapping out the hinterlands, toppling resistant city-states in the most violent
  manner possible, setting up terrorist groups who raided towns and cities for recruitment and
  enslavement, levelling resistant cities to rubble and stealing everything not screwed down.
</p>
<p>
  By 1807, the Abolition of the Slave Trade had entered the statute book of the British, the most
  powerful slaver of the era. In 1833, the Slavery Abolition Act was passed again by the same
  British Government.
</p>
<p>
  Between 1830 and 1866, over 850,000 West Africans were violently taken from their families, their
  mothers, fathers, and siblings, they were forced on slave ships and taken to new, hostile, lands.
  Between 1525 and 1866 over 12 million people had been kidnapped from West African shores, less
  than 10.5 million made it to slave farms in the Americas, where under inhumane conditions, they
  toiled in every major industry, extracting precious metals, cutting timber, building railways,
  harvesting coffee, cultivating tobacco, cotton, sugar, being used for medical “experiments.”
</p>
<p>
  The wealth and “civilisation” of the global north was built on the backs of these human beings,
  who till-date, still do the most backbreaking work under intolerable circumstances and are
  brutalised in the same manner their ancestors were during the slave trade era. Their reserves
  filled with gold stolen, tricked or taken through corruption, an endemic corruption sown into
  every colonial system, alongside degradation and erasure.
</p>
<p>
  Do the people back on the continent think about the slave trade? Don’t the people on the continent
  carry the trauma of loss in their DNA? Have the people on the continent acknowledged this pain and
  grief and not having closure? Have we examined the manner in which colonialists set up governments
  and systems on the continent? These extractive and violent police states with corruption deeply
  embedded in their governance. Have we compared it to the way and manner systems are designed in
  the global north to extract from, reduce and violate black bodies in the diaspora?
</p>
<h5>HAVE WE?</h5>
<p>
  Between 1525 and 1866, over 12 million families in West Africa lost their homes, their valuables,
  and their loved ones. These families that were left behind to gather their shattered bits
  together, to re-start from nothing. People who had to tattoo the faces of the children left to
  them in case they got stolen and had to be rescued. They were afraid to mourn their loved ones for
  they did not know if their child was lost or their child died.
</p>
<p>
  Isn’t it better for one’s child to die and transit to another plane than for the child to be lost?
  Ọmọ ẹni kú sàn jù ọmọ ẹni nù lọ.
</p>
<p>
  The ones that waited their lifetimes hopeful, hopeless. Those who lit lamps praying it would lead
  their loved ones home. Huge chunks of their hearts wandering the face of the earth seeking those
  whom they’ve loved and lost. Passing the trauma of violence and loss down to their generations
  even as we grapple with colonialism, capitalist systems designed to keep us at the bottom of the
  food chain, western education and most recently religious fundamentalism – tools designed to keep
  inflicting pain on us even though we’d lost so much.

  I went to Ọ̀ ṣun, unlike previous times this was more than a visit, it was a conscious return to my
  roots, to the Òòsà and Irúnmolè, offering myself up, asking for restoration, for peace. I carried
  along with me friends, those who had asked for prayers. I carried with me my ancestors, those
  alive and those that had crossed to Àjùlé Ọ̀ run.
</p>
<p>
  I sat by the river, dipped my feet in the flowing waters. The names of the ones I carried along
  with me on my lips. As I mentioned each name I asked for blessings, clarification. I asked that Ọ̀
  ṣun cleanse them, help them take charge of their bodies, their anxieties, just as I asked to be
  cleansed. Ọ̀ ṣun took these names one after the other, she took my anxieties and fears, and
  returned to me my ancestors, because they are the only ones I should be carrying in my body. For
  they are encoded in my DNA. As I sat by the river, feet in the flowing waters. Ọ̀ ṣun gave me back
  the missing parts of me. She mentioned their names, the names of my ancestors, giving them back to
  me, for they are my lost selves.

  “I’m going to get a visa and travel to Paris to look for work,” my uncle said, with a smile on his
  face. “Like you, I want to live in Europe and earn money so I can look after your cousins and
  auntie.” There was a flash of a million dreams glimmering in his eyes. I tried to picture him in
  Paris: standing in a street corner in the cold October rain, trying to figure out his next move
  and how he was so far from everyone he knows and loves. I imagined him approaching store managers
  and asking them whether they have any vacancies, and I thought of the pitying smiles and looks
  they would probably shoot his way, glancing at the weather-inappropriate beige bomber jacket he
  loved so much, and the slightly-too-big trousers he had bought for 40,000 CFA from the market in
  Dakar. He’d carefully packed them in his suitcase and traveled halfway across the world in search
  of a better life, diving head-first into the unknown.
</p>
<p>
  I didn’t know how to begin explaining the dirty looks of hatred and prejudice and the
  disappointment he was likely to be subject to if he moved to Europe. How, for the past decade, the
  atmosphere in Europe had grown increasingly hostile towards immigrants, and how every country
  seemed to have its own Farage, Le Pen, Salvini, and Orban – with thousands of people listening to
  their toxic words; just waiting for a call-to-action. I did not want him to one day have to hear
  the callousness behind the words: “There is no more space here. Europe is full. Go back to Africa
  instead of coming to free-load over here!” I didn’t have the heart to tell him how, most likely,
  he would end up underpaid and overworked at a job.
</p>
<p>
  With little to no career progression options and unsociable working hours, while struggling to
  make ends meet. I had no words to explain to him how exhausting and unnerving it is to always feel
  like the “other” – and how your body starts to crave being surrounded by people who look like you
  and being somewhere you can go incognito once again and breathe a little easier, instead of
  feeling like you’re constantly walking under a magnifying glass, having to be on your best
  behaviour; constantly proving to white people that you are not like “the others” – and that you
  are hard-working and honest, worthy of living in this country you picked to carve a life out for
  yourself. Or that, even the Thieboudienne he would find somewhere in the 18th arrondissement would
  never taste anything like it does at home.
</p>
<p>
  Despite what many white Europeans want us to believe, Black people have always been in Europe. We
  are very much here and we will always be. When St Maurice, an Egyptian born in AD 250, became the
  leader of the legendary Roman Theban Legion, I wonder how his troops received him, and if he was
  treated as an oddity, whether his skin color was nothing out of the ordinary to most people.
  Despite clear evidence of Africans having a presence in Europe from the third century onwards,
  there still exists a notion that African Europeans have only come here recently. Olivette Otele’s
  book, African Europeans: An Untold History delves into the long-spanning and diverse links between
  the two continents.
</p>

<p>
  Just a few weeks ago, an elected politician, mortally offended that I made a distinction between
  white Finnish people and Black Finnish people, tweeted at me to tell me that I do not need to
  specify the skin color of Finns because Finnish people are always white and that I should go back
  to Senegal. There are no official figures of how many people of African heritage there are in
  Finland because ethnicity is not recorded in national statistics. According to estimates by
  Statistics Finland, the figure lies around <b>50,000 Afro-Finns</b>. Despite consistently topping
  charts in education, quality of life, and happiness levels, Finland has also recently taken the
  pole position as the country where Black people and Africans experience the most racism. The
  European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights’ Being Black in the EU revealed that
  <b>63% of people of African descent</b> in Finland have experienced racial harassment. The figure
  was considerably higher than in the other 12 countries surveyed in the study. I’m all too aware of
  “weathering,” a term that refers to the deterioration of health as a result of long-term stress
  and cumulative effects of being exposed to systemic racism your whole life.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since I can remember, I’ve been told to be understanding and patient, because the racists and
  the ignorants fear what they do not know. To them, I represent a threat so real that it makes
  grown men shout slurs at 7-year-old me, and it makes old ladies spit on my brand new coat as I
  stand on the street.
</p>
<h5>AND SO I WAIT</h5>
<p>
  I’ve been waiting. I waited in the 1980s. And the 90s. Then the 00s – all the way until the 2010s.
  It’s now the 2020s, and I am still waiting. The microaggressions that forever remind me I am
  “other,” like the shopkeeper who addresses me in English rather than my native Finnish; to the
  white man quizzing me about my roots, not settling for my answer when he asks where I am from, and
  I reply, “Helsinki.”
</p>
<p>
  My phone screen lights up and a Twitter notification pops up as a response to an article I wrote
  about inequality and racism in Europe.
</p>
<blockquote>If you’re so unhappy here, why don’t you f*** off back to Africa.</blockquote>
<p><i>Charming.</i></p>
<p>
  As James Baldwin said much more eloquently: “What is it that you wanted me to reconcile myself to?
  I was born here more than 60 years ago. I’m not going to live another 60 years. You always told me
  that it’s going to take time. It’s taken my father’s time, my mother’s time, my uncle’s time, my
  brothers’ and my sisters’ time, my nieces, and my nephew’s time. How much time do you want for
  your progress?”
</p>
<p>
  In a speech delivered on the 28th of August 1963, Rep. John Lewis, the American statesman and
  civil rights leader, who died earlier this year said: “To those who have said, ‘Be patient and
  wait,’ we have long said that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we
  want to be free now!”
</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I feel like I have waited long enough. Time’s up.</p>
<p>
  At the risk of sounding self-serving, I’m often unsure of how to refer to myself, or how I
  identify. The quick answer is that I’m Finnish-Senegalese. The long version is that I was born in
  Finland, where I lived until I was 8 and moved to Luxembourg and then, a few years later, to
  Belgium. And from there, I moved to London, where I have spent the last 14 years. And no, I don’t
  know where home is. I don’t feel very Finnish, or very Senegalese. And although London has been
  home, I don’t feel like I belong here either. Sometimes I wonder if the need to identify as
  something is for me – or whether I am trying to make myself more explainable to others.
</p>
<img src="/images/temp/beyond-borders/img-03.jpg" alt="Beyond Borders" />
<p>
  Depending on the situation and people I am interacting with, my identity changes. When I am away
  from Finland, my “Finnishness” is heightened: I cook Finnish food, vibe out to Finnish songs, and
  observe Finnish traditions. When I am in Finland, it has almost the complete opposite effect: I
  feel like a fish out of water, like a cheap impostor. I used to say I’m half Finnish and half
  Senegalese – but as a friend asked, “Which half of you is which?” Half implies that I am not
  whole, half means incomplete. Finnish-Senegalese seems like a happy medium that allows me to claim
  both, without divvying up any of my body parts.
</p>
<p>
  The first record of an African in Finland is from 1875, when the Finnish missionary brought a girl
  named Eva Maria Nangurashi, from Ovamboland, modern-day Namibia. However, it’s reported she did
  not adapt well to her new “home” and returned to her real home soon after.
</p>
<p>
  A little more is known about Rosa Lemberg (born Clay); the first African with Finnish citizenship.
  Rosa was born in the village of Omaruru, in modern-day Namibia, on August 31, 1875. Despite
  several attempts to embellish or romanticize the story of how Rosa came into being, I try not to
  think too much about the likelihood of uncomfortably sickening events that led to Rosa’s creation.
  Her mother was a young local woman, and her father was a British man named Charles William Clay.
  At two months, Rosa was taken from her mother to live with an English missionary family. I shudder
  as I read the sentence; catching myself just in time before I continued to read. I keep thinking,
  if the missionaries had to snatch Rosa from her screaming mother’s arms, if they took her baby
  while she was sleeping or otherwise busy. Did they convince the young mother (and themselves) that
  they were acting in good faith – and in the name of god? They probably told Rosa’s mother that she
  will have a great life! She’ll see things you could never even dream about! We can offer her so
  much better than this life here, with you, as her heart shattered into a million little pieces,
  her arms forever aching for the daughter she would no longer be able to hold. How long did it take
  for her baby’s cries to stop haunting her nights?
</p>
<img src="/images/temp/beyond-borders/img-04.jpg" alt="Rosa Lemberg" />
<p>
  Rosa ended up in a missionary school run by a Finnish couple, Karl and Ida Weikkolin, who brought
  her to Finland when she was 13. What did she think or feel when she looked at the disappearing
  coastline of her homeland? Did she wipe tears into the corner of her sleeve, and reassure herself
  that she would one day return? Did she feel sadness, confusion, fear, excitement or trepidation –
  or a mixture of all of the above? When she arrived in Finland, a newspaper, Wiipurin Uutiset, on
  June 8, 1888, announced the arrival of “a mulatto girl, born and baptized in Africa.” The term,
  derived from “little mule” in Spanish, makes me flinch. Did the white Finns gawk at Rosa as she
  walked down the street? Did she have to smile politely as they touched her hair without asking?
  Did she pretend not to hear the giggling and the laughter behind her back, and remind herself to
  just smile and hold her head up high, as she walked?
</p>
<p>
  Rosa was sent to school, but during holidays, the Weikkolins paraded her and held performances
  where Rosa sang songs in an African language she did not even know. If she refused, her adoptive
  mother, Ida – who described herself as a kind, warm-hearted benevolent Christian woman in her
  memoirs – would hit her and treat her like an unpaid maid. Rosa described her time in Finland with
  the Weikkolins like this: “Everywhere there were curious audiences. After all, everyone wanted to
  see the only Negro in Finland.
</p>
<p>
  Everyone wanted to hear that Negro pray and sing in those strange African tongues. At every event,
  the collection brought in a lot of money; magnificent amounts, in fact. But I never got as much as
  five pennies to put towards buying sweets... Many a time during the first weeks I spent in
  Finland, I would sob and wish that I were still in Ovamboland with my own tribe.”
</p>
<p>
  Rosa graduated in 1889 and received Finnish citizenship on the 1st of September 1899. She worked
  as a teacher but often considered moving away. She fell in love, but her fiancé, a Russian doctor,
  killed himself (said to have been a suspected psychotic episode resulting from the drugs he had
  experimented on himself with) shortly before they were due to marry – and Rosa, devastated and
  possibly re-evaluating her entire life – left Finland in 1904. When she arrived in New York, she
  did not speak any English. She sought the company of Finns living there. At first, they were
  suspicious of her and did not accept her. But when they realized she spoke perfect Finnish, they
  welcomed her into their community. Rosa became a well-liked and respected member of the
  Finnish-American community. She was a choir leader, an actress, singer, teacher and director. She
  got married and had two children, Irja and Orvo, and raised them as a single mother after
  divorcing her husband soon after the birth of her son. She worked tirelessly and was able to fund
  acting and singing classes for her children, who performed at Chicago’s Imperial Hall on many
  occasions. Rosa died in 1959 in a Finnish care home in a small town in Illinois.
</p>

<p>
  I am not related to Rosa Clay (heck, I’m not even from Namibia!) – yet, the more I read about her,
  the more connected I feel to her. So much of Rosa’s story feels similar to mine. I understand the
  spitting, the whispering and the constant reminders that you are the “other.” I know the looks and
  the stares, the prodding and the poking – like that time my friend’s grandmother asked to see the
  palms of my hands and soles of my feet, how she asked me to take my socks off so she could take a
  proper look (and how I obliged because my eight-year-old self did not know that I could say “No,
  you weird old stranger lady!”). I took my socks off – despite the fact that this bizarre intrusion
  was interrupting a game of Hungry Hippos I was playing with my friends – and let her gasp with
  amazement at the paleness of my hands and feet. “My goodness! I’ve never seen you people up close!
  How strange… so strange... Fascinating.” I felt like I wanted the freshly polished parquet floor
  underneath my now bare feet to open up and swallow me into the pits of hell, without really
  understanding why I felt the way I did.
</p>
<p>
  I know the hypervisibility and hyper awareness that comes from existing as a Black person in
  Europe; like constantly walking under a microscope – but at the same time, feeling forever
  invisible, as our existence here is often questioned or outright denied. Rosa Clay has become
  proof that we are just as entitled to claim Finnishness as our identity: “See! She looks like me,
  and she lived here a hundred years before me!” Poor Rosa. What would she think if she knew she was
  being used as a token? What would she feel if she knew that, in so many ways, very little has
  changed for Africans in Europe in one century?
</p>
<p>
  I had to see if I could find any more information about what happened to Rosa Lemberg’s lineage,
  if her story had a happy ending. So I tracked down Rosa’s great-great-granddaughter, AnnaLee
  Jacobs, a white woman living near Chicago.
</p>
<p>
  “My grandmother Normalee, daughter of Irja Lemberg, was born in 1928. We know that Irja had been
  so severely bullied as a child because of her dark skin, that she kept her mother’s African
  heritage a secret until her death. We had no idea about our African ancestry until after she died.
  I always remember her wearing hats and long sleeves in the summer when we played in her garden –
  and now it makes sense why she did it: she wanted to keep her skin as fair as possible. We
  subsequently found out that, when Irja gave birth to my grandmother Normalee, she was so shocked
  by her baby’s dark skin tone that she attempted to kill herself and her newborn baby. I cannot
  even imagine the awful things that she must have lived through for her to feel tormented to that
  point.”
</p>
<p>
  “It was a confusing time for us; trying to piece together the puzzle and uncover the side of the
  family that had been hidden from us. Perhaps strangely, our family has always embraced the Swedish
  side of our heritage and traditions – even to the extreme. At family dinners, we would eat Nordic
  delicacies, like lingonberry jam, and my grandmother was known for cooking traditional Swedish
  lutefisk – dried whitefish, pickled in lye – for our Christmas Eve dinner. I’m ashamed and
  embarrassed that my family felt they had to hide their Black heritage. And I feel terrible about
  the things that Rosa must have gone through: to grow up being treated like an oddity and being
  forced to perform and sing like a circus freak. It’s interesting to me, that Rosa managed to build
  a home within the Finnish community in Chicago – but that Irja was so severely ridiculed… I find
  it interesting that Rosa never returned to Europe or Africa. If Rosa were here now, I would ask
  her how she managed to achieve so much and be so well-respected within the community, as a single
  mother of two young children, during The Great Depression. She sounds like a pretty remarkable
  woman.”
</p>
<p>
  Yet again, Rosa’s story probably seems familiar to many Black and brown people living in
  majority-white countries: going out of our ways to do a million things at once, and overachieve in
  everything we set out to do. Constantly attempting to prove our worth and resilience and
  resourcefulness. We are not allowed to be mediocre – or, god forbid less than mediocre. We have to
  prove our value; slipping uncomfortably but seamlessly into respectability politics, and show we
  are able to provide a valuable contribution to this capitalist society of ours. I have to often
  remind myself that we are allowed to just be.
</p>
<p>
  African and European are still often considered as two separate categories, but surely the concept
  is now too limiting in our ever-changing world and increasing ethnic diversity? Can we really not
  inhabit two spaces at once? Do I have to pick myself apart, and choose which I align myself with
  more? The term “Afropean,” popularized by Belgian-Congolese singer Marie Daulne, is used to refer
  to mixed race people with African heritage, or members of the African diaspora living in Europe. I
  like the term, as it removes the Senegalese-Finnish dichotomy I so often feel stuck in, and
  creates a hybrid. It allows me to be whole, and exist in both spaces at once. In his book
  Afropean: Notes from Black Europe, author and photographer Johny Pitts documents his travels
  across the continent, meeting people of African heritage along his way. He says the term helped
  him to think of himself as ‘unhyphenated.’ That’s what I crave, too. But, much like the term
  “Third Culture Kid,” which refers to children who have spent the majority of their lives in a
  culture other than their own – Afropean has unsavoury connotations of elitism, and seems to be
  applied to mostly light-skinned African Europeans with university degrees and passports that give
  them access to most countries around the globe. Pitts acknowledges this privilege, and also
  questions who the term applies to.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes, I cringe at a version of myself from five years ago, who had idealistic views of a
  globalized earth with mixed-heritage people populating the earth. Now, I am aware of the privilege
  and problematic connotations attached to that ideal. It reminds me of the irksome N ational
  Geographic article that hailed the future face of America being… beige. Since having children, I
  have become unpleasantly accustomed to the fetishization of mixed-heritage children that seems to
  be commonplace. I feel like all this plays directly into the hands of white supremacy and the
  erasure of Blackness. Throughout history, white people have attempted to weed out Blackness – and
  I feel like “we will all be mixed-race one day!” is just another step towards that: Black is not
  accepted, but light-skinned people with Eurocentric features are preferable and palatable.
</p>
<p>
  Senghor had visions of cultural métissage: the cultural mixing of society. He would advise his
  compatriots to “assimilate in order to not be assimilated,” but believed this can only happen once
  Africans have a thorough understanding of their roots and history, and only once African identity
  is situated in a literary tradition. Only then will the playing field be even, and Africans can
  begin to participate on the global stage with all other cultures, and selectively incorporate
  ideas and parts of different cultures into their society. I feel like we are a long way from being
  able to do that. You cannot reform a system built on injustice and equality; you have to dismantle
  it and build it up again.
</p>
<p>
  It seems that all around Europe, there is a deep-seated reluctance and outright denial of any past
  wrongdoings. Any mention of these evils of the past is quickly met with “whataboutery.” Things are
  bubbling under the surface, with separatist movements and referendums increasingly gaining
  traction (Scotland and Catalan, and the potential crumbling of the United Kingdom following
  Britain’s exit from the European Union). Perhaps the time has come to reassess nation-states, and
  whether they are fit-for-purpose.
</p>
<p>
  I have grown more aware of how borders are used to distinguish between “us” and “them,” and
  instill in us a sense that we are somehow more worthy than others. We have managed to convince
  ourselves that we are entitled and deserving of what we have. Being able to enjoy freedom of
  movement across the European Union states and feeling that others are not as deserving, simply
  because our legal system has been built in a way to not grant everyone those same rights.
</p>
<p>
  With the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become evident that countries are using borders to shut out
  asylum seekers, and hiding under the cloak of distraction provided by the global crisis. While we
  have been cocooned in our homes, some European states have been busy hardening their stance on
  border control and immigration. A perfect excuse, no? While we have been taking to the streets en
  masse, shouting ”Black Lives Matter!” With white people perfecting their performance of good
  allyship, Black and brown people are drowning in the Mediterranean and in the English Channel, and
  no one seems to bat an eyelid. European states regularly ignore Mayday calls from rescue boats
  trawling the seas in the hopes of finding survivors despite their obligation under international
  maritime law to rescue every person in danger at sea, regardless of nationality or legal status.
  The ones who survive the crossing are placed in detention centres and camps with inhumane living
  conditions. Because nevermind what the laws say – this is a question of humanity. As of 17th
  September 2020, there have been 592 migrant deaths recorded on the Mediterranean this year but the
  true figure is likely to be much higher. But Black Lives Matter, right? Just, maybe not these.
</p>
<p>
  The lucky ones are those who get picked up, who only have minor fuel burns and dehydration. The
  unlucky ones are those forever sleeping on the sea bed; never to be found, never to be searched
  for. Their friends and families left wondering if by some miracle or other divine intervention,
  their loved one managed to make it ashore. And then, after countless desperate prayers whispered
  into the wee hours of the night towards the heavens, and months spent waiting for the phone to
  ring, or a letter to arrive, only to admit defeat, eventually succumbing to heartbreak, and
  bracing themselves for the next family member or friend to decide if they might be lucky enough to
  make it and be able to build a new life or home somewhere else.

<p>
  At the moment, for me, home is nowhere. I exist in-between, as I have just uprooted my family and
  moved to my country of birth, where I have not lived for nearly a quarter of a century. The driver
  behind our move is the political situation in the United Kingdom, and the main draw about a move
  to Finland is its affordable childcare and proximity to nature and the sea. I am terrified and
  excited and unsure of how I will adjust and cope with the transition of moving back to Finland. At
  the moment, living in Europe feels like my entire house is on fire, and I am unsure of what to
  save first. A never-ending game of whack-a-mole where a new problem crops up as soon as one is
  fixed. I feel disconnected; desperately trying to find some steady ground to bury my feet in so I
  can draw a deep breath for the first time in what feels like months, if not years. In her 2005
  essay about Afropolitanism, “Bye-Bye Babar”, author Taiye Selasi offers that figuring out one’s
  identity is an enriching experience, as it helps us expand perspectives on “nation and selfhood.”
  She writes about the multi-dimensionality and complexity of what constitutes as being “African,”
  that the identity of Afropolitans is three-dimensional; national, cultural and racial identity. I
  hope I find this inner equilibrium soon.
</p>
<p>
  So what happens when you feel like your home is not a physical place in any country, but a
  feeling?
</p>
<p>
  “Home is where I feel at peace. It’s where my friends are, and where I feel safe. It’s where I’m
  able to take up physical and political space, and can live free of the fear of microaggressions,”
  says Adéọlá Naomi Adérèmí, a Greek-Nigerian living in Belgium, and founder of Distinguished Diva,
  a multi-disciplinary online collective and platform for women of African heritage across the
  globe. “People move around the world; they always have. They shift and evolve. To me, “belonging”
  is all about what and who I am when I move away from where I feel at home. Despite not having a
  Ghanaian heritage, I instantly feel at home when I walk the streets of Accra. The sounds, the
  smells, and the sights instantly feel familiar,” she says.
</p>
<p>
  Adéọlá has never felt disconnected from her “Africanness,” as her Yoruba heritage is evident in
  her family life. When I ask her this question, I wonder if she pities me a little, as I project my
  own hopefully short-lived identity crisis on her. She grew up listening to her grandmother’s
  stories and attributes a large part of why she is so in touch with her African identity despite
  living in Europe to the fact she speaks several languages. “I feel very west African,” she says.
  “I speak Yoruba and Hausa, as well as English, Greek, and French – which opens up a lot of
  opportunities, and I can comfortably travel around Africa. Where I belong and where I feel a sense
  of allegiance to are not about nation-states or borders for me. But I must say and acknowledge the
  fact that this is a very privileged way of looking at identity and nationality. Many people on
  this planet do not have the option to choose between multiple countries and identities, and many
  are not able to move between countries as freely as I am.”
</p>
<p>
  I can relate to the importance of language in holding a strong connection with your roots: I do
  not speak my father’s language, Seereer, and it serves as a constant reminder of my inadequacies
  as a bona fide Senegalese. My father is somewhat a pioneer of the Seereer language: he has
  dedicated roughly twenty years to translating Léopold Sédar Senghor’s poems from French to
  Seereer, their shared native language.
</p>
<p>
  Asides translating Senghor’s poems, he has just published a three-volume essay series analyzing
  and explaining the poems in detail. He hopes students will be able to use the material to better
  connect with Senghor’s work. But as long as students in Senegal are primarily educated in French
  and English, their relationship with their heritage will remain distant.

  I feel like I should rest. I feel as though I have been stuck in the capitalist, white supremacist
  grind culture, where productivity is put above mental and physical wellbeing. Resting means
  retaliating. Putting my needs before theirs. I ask Adéọlá if she has any tips for me, for
  grounding myself. “My grandmother always used to say that the sun, sea, and salt can fix
  everything. I find all of those things through nature and food. Since my grandmother died, I have
  reclaimed my relationship with nature. Capitalism has destroyed the close relationship we used to
  have with earth, and natural resources have been violated – and we have lost a large part of our
  heritage. Reclaiming nature, and doing ancestral work and divination is what helps me feel
  grounded. Often, it’s also a good idea to learn about the indigenous cultures of wherever you are,
  as they are often the people with the deepest connection to the land you are living on,” she says.
  That makes sense to me.
</p>
<p>
  The Sámi are the only indigenous people of the European Union, and the total Sámi population is
  estimated to be over 75,000, with the majority living in Norway. In Finland, there are about
  10,000 Sámi.
</p>
<p>
  They have been subjected to awful practices by the Finnish government (from humiliating
  skull-measurements to forced assimilation, where Sámi children were forcibly taken from their
  families and until the 1970s, they were brought to be schooled in strict boarding houses, where
  they were prevented from speaking their native language). Despite this, the Sámi have managed to
  pass their languages and other cultural heritage to future generations, and there has been greater
  visibility and promotion of Sámi culture in Finland. But there is still a long way to go, as many
  white Finns simply fail to acknowledge the Finnish government’s role as a colonizer. Finland has
  yet to ratify the Indigenous and
</p>
<p>
  Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169), which protects the rights of indigenous people in the
  country, for more than 30 years. We are no closer to ending the gridlock.
</p>
<p>
  In my forever quest to decolonize my mind and decenter whiteness, I turn my attention to
  afro-centrist theories. I enjoy the utopian ideas of borderlessness and pan-Africanism. Among all
  the chaos, this seems like a good place to rest for a while. A place where I can dream of unity
  and revel in the idea of a shared history, and the idea that the destinies of all the people of
  Africa and its diaspora are connected. To read what others have already said about the world, and
  learn from the works of elders who led the way, and whose words are still painfully pertinent
  today. But I still feel we need to keep our eyes firmly ahead, and create a new future for
  ourselves, rather than lean too much on the past.
</p>
<p>
  I speak to Minna Salami, author, speaker and founder of Ms Afropolitan.com to see if she has
  advice on how to bridge the gap between the past, the present and the future. In her
  recently-published book, Sensuous Knowledge: A Black Feminist Approach for Everyone, she coins the
  concept of Exousiance, which looks at power, its connection and co-existence with the non-human
  natural world, feminist theory and social criticism. “Connecting the past, present and future is
  precisely what we should be doing. There is not one discourse or theory that is more useful than
  another. The times we live in are so incredibly complex, and what we need is a hybrid and a
  mish-mash and an interweaving and interconnecting and synthesizing of all of these different
  ideological framings including, of course, feminism. Which again, is not one type of feminism we
  need, but we need to draw from Black feminism, from African feminism, from radical feminism. The
  best ideas and most useful stories are those that are treating these issues with complexity and
  layerendess, and looking at the non-human natural world as a kind of storyteller. We can ground
  ourselves by drawing from the poetry in the non-human natural world and elsewhere, utilizing the
  arts, and incorporating meditative practices with feminist theory, for example.”
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the move to Finland is precisely what my body and mind need at this moment. I try to draw
  peace from the fact I now live in a place where I am surrounded by nature. On the first day we
  arrived, I stood in the middle of the forest, surrounded by only trees, with the sound of
  thousands of pine needles swaying in the autumn breeze creating a continuous shushing sound, as if
  to sooth my weary soul – and breathed deeply for what felt like the first time in months. Drawing
  from what has always been here and will be here long after I am gone feels like a good place to
  start finding myself again. Whether it is the baobabs overlooking my paternal ancestral village in
  Senegal or this pine forest next door to my new home. Trees seem like the logical things to ground
  myself with. I am aware of the power that lies within me, the greatest threat to racists and
  xenophobes, my unapologetic joy, and that is what I am determined to find.
</p>
<p>
  For now, I have to retain a little bit of hope as everything around me seems bleak. I look at the
  next generation, and hope their upbringing will be different from my generation’s. I keep seeing
  calls for more diversity and tolerance but I hate those words. “Tolerance” implies you accept
  something, even though you disagree with it. I hope the next generation can lean on their
  ancestors to remind them of where they came from and rely on them to point which way to go in
  future. I hope these kids are raised to be troublemakers that simply refuse to accept the status
  quo.
</p>
<p>
  Divisions within physical spaces, geographical borders, and socio-economic lines have become
  commonplace since the global financial crisis of 2008. Migration has become the fuel that fires
  far-right politics across the European continent. Indifference towards injustices faced by
  migrants and asylum seekers have become the norm to Europeans. At times, it feels like there is no
  hope left on this continent. I think of my uncle, sitting on a stool on his porch, sipping on some
  attaya under a big mango tree, and going to bed dreaming of Europe as a place with endless
  possibilities. I think of Rosa Clay, who, despite feeling like she could not thrive in Europe,
  still sought out the Finnish community in America – the only thing she had ever really known after
  crossing an ocean to find some peace. Perhaps we are all just floating; forever searching for a
  place where our souls can find rest.

      In Senegal, a country of nearly 16 million, inhabitants of a little village in the South
      struggle to rebuild their dwellings after nearly 40 years of conflict. Between the stakes
      of relocation and the remnants of an endless war, their resilience and hard work offer
      lifetime lessons of perseverance and hope.
      </p>
      <p>
      On Saturday, December 21, 2019, Jean de Dieu Sagna, a resident of Bouhouyou, did not
      return from Ziguinchor where he had gone early that morning. Stella, his wife, assumed he
      was spending the night at one of his brothers’ as he sometimes did. But he had been hit by
      a car that night on his way back home.
      </p>
      <p>
      Stella, who was informed the following day, thought that Jean de Dieu was injured and
      admitted in the regional hospital of Ziguinchor. His brothers went to the hospital to find
      that he died the night before. To claim the corpse, the Sagna brothers had to collect,
      among other documents, a requisition from the Gendarmerie, a death certificate from the
      doctor in charge and an inhumation permit. They went back to the village 14 kilometres
      away in a view to come back the following day. They went back and forth Bouhouyou and
      Ziguinchor for four days before they could lay Jean de Dieu to rest in the cemetery at
      Nyassia.
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/c7kX9yL.png" alt="" />
      <p>
      The late farmer was born in Kailou and Stella’s home village is Bassere. Both villages are
      a five-hour walk away from Bouhouyou, the Sagnas’ current dwelling. And they are all part
      of the 25 villages of Nyassia, a rural community in the department of Ziguinchor. In this
      conglomerate of little isolated villages, public transportation is scarce. Residents move
      back and forth on raggedy taxi bikes, called Jakartas and, occasionally in rusty minibuses
      called minicar or gëlë-gëlë in Wolof. Most of the time, they walk or get on donkey carts
      to get to the Faroo (family rice farms) or to any nearby urban centre where they can
      access facilities like dispensaries and administrative offices.
      </p>
      <p>
      Stella can neither read nor write. “Jangu ma,” she said, as if to apologize when I asked
      her age. She had Ibou Peter Dieme, the teacher and our intermediary, read her ID card.
      During all our following phone conversations, the 46 year widow calls onto her nephew
      Abraham Bassene for precisions on dates and years. Yet, it was Stella who told me the day
      Jean de Dieu was run over on the side of the road.
      </p>
      <p>
      The second time I called, I couldn’t talk to Stella. Her battery was low and her nephew
      had to plug the phone in Ziguinchor. I received her call early in the afternoon the
      following day and she apologized again:
      <i> “Xale bi bi mu ñëwee, dama demoon àlla ba. ”</i> Alla ba is the wood around Bouhouyou
      where residents cut timber for their household cooking and occasionally for commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
      In the rainy season, Stella spends her days between the woods and two small plots of land.
      She grows peanuts on a 200-square-metre field and rice at the Faroo. After the harvest,
      she stores the peanuts for cooking, the rice for rituals and celebrations. Stella buys the
      rice she needs for consumption. The plight of the Sagna family is typical in rural
      Senegal. But for the inhabitants of the south, the geographic and political situation sets
      real challenges and regularly tests their survival skills.

      <h3>
      The economic potentialities of Casamance earned it the tag “the storehouse of Senegal,”
      rich in natural resources, large forests, thriving agriculture, and bountiful fisheries
      </h3>
      <p>
      Casamance is composed of the regions of Kolda, Sedhiou and Ziguinchor and lies between the
      Atlantic Ocean, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea and Tambacounda. It is crossed by the
      300-km-long Casamance River, and a portion of the Gambia River. The area is well
      irrigated, with a network of bolongs emanating from the mangrove forests. In 2018, nearly
      90% of the rice production of the country came from the region. Casamance is home to one
      of the first touristic hubs in Senegal. Cap Skirring a village 84 kilometres away from
      Bouhouyou, is renowned for its pristine beaches, its big hotels among which is the Club
      Med, and an airport – one of three in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
      Paradoxically, the majority Casamance residents do not enjoy decent living conditions.
      Many are poor farmers, fishermen and craftsmen battling poverty, unavailability of land
      and unemployment. On May 30, 2020, the Gendarmerie heavily repressed a protest against the
      lack of running water, leaving many injured.
      </p>
      <p>
      Ziguinchor which is 435km away from Dakar, the capital city in the north is more
      accessible through the Gambia. But the route between the north and the south of Senegal is
      strenuous and literally debilitating due to difficulties linked to border transit,
      harassment by security forces all along the road, the lack of an organized and formal
      public transportation system. Passengers were often obliged to spend the night at the
      border, in order to cross the Gambia river early in the morning. There are other
      alternatives to crossing the river, like a flight, shipping from Dakar to Zigunichor or
      vice versa and a bus via Tambacounda.
      </p>
      <p>
      However, these are unaffordable for the majority of residents. The detour via Tambacounda
      is longer and more expensive. The cost of a flight, 65,000 francs, is 10 times higher than
      that of a bus ticket. And there has been a distrust in maritime transportation since the
      wreck of the Joola ferry on September 26, 2002, in which nearly 2,000 people died.
      </p>

      <p>
      Another strain on southern Senegal has been the conflict between the MFDC (Movement of
      Democratic Forces of Casamance) and the Senegalese army since 1982. The years 1982-2000,
      which coincided with the rule of former President Abdou Diouf were trying times for
      families in Ziguinchor and its surroundings. Violent fights and abuses trapped residents
      and tore many families apart as they fled the ravaged villages. Many settled in the
      suburbs of Ziguinchor and in cities on either side of the Gambian and Guinea-Bissauan
      borders. Ismaila Diedhiou, head of ANRAC in Ziguinchor, reports 30,000 displaced and
      16,000 refugees.
      </p>
      <p>
      Stella and Jean de Dieu lived for more than 15 years in a house lent by one of their aunts
      at the periphery of Ziguinchor, in Kadialang. They raised their five children and two
      adopted nephews. Jean de Dieu was a brave and hardworking man who didn’t refuse small jobs
      to provide for his family.
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JgFp6Qa.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
      Years of exile didn’t deter the Sagnas from farming. Abraham told me that, while
      displaced, the whole family walked back and forth Ziguinchor and the Faroo in Bouhouyou,
      every day of every rainy season. They would walk 14km in the morning, work till the
      evening, and then walk back. Occasionally, Jean de Dieu would cut timber in the nearby
      wood which his nephew sold at the Ziguinchor market. Thanks to this tradition of hard
      work, the Sagna children were able to enroll in school. The struggle was however to pursue
      education.
      </p>
      <p>
      Abraham, born in 1987 started primary school at 7. But due to displacement, he sat for the
      secondary exam three times before graduating in 2003. The family lost his birth
      certificate, a civil registration document mandatory to pass national exams. He dropped
      out in 2010 just before passing his high school diploma (baccalaureate) and has been
      working on the family farms since then.

      <h3>
      Abraham and his cousins escaped the fate of many displaced children whose parents were
      compelled to abandon or were unable to take care of.
      </h3>
      <p>
      Many grassroots organizations and NGOs offer assistance to these families to alleviate
      their hardships. One of them, Kabonketoor regularly organizes court hearings and
      proceedings to facilitate civil registration for children. For 20 years, the collective of
      nearly 3,000 women has been a regular stakeholder in peace negotiations in Casamance. They
      regularly organize women empowerment workshops and assist families with schooling.
      Kabonketoor funds training sessions, provides counselling and contributes to the
      construction of basic social facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
      The caucus offers a safe place and psychological support to victims of the conflict. Ndeye
      Marie Sagna Le Caer, director of Kabonketoor, tells me over the phone. Central to their
      vision are also autonomy and hard work of beneficiaries. In this view the collective funds
      income-generating activities and initiated the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS). Le
      Caer insists on the organisation’s core values, embedded in Casamance principles of
      cohesion, solidarity and mutuality. She says it’s the reason the organization works
      indistinctly with the displaced and residents in Ziguinchor and Sedhiou. “Designating
      refugees and displaced people can be a source of discrimination and frustration.”
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/OWyTFNo.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
      International organizations are other important stakeholders in Casamance, assisting the
      government and citizens with different development projects. The International Committee
      of the Red Cross (ICRC) has supported the relocation of displaced persons. The
      organisation helped the Sagnas during their relocation by equipping them with sheet
      plates, spikes and ronier palm wood to rebuild their house. The ICRC also facilitates
      re-adaptation by funding water installation and income-generating activities. According to
      a 2016 report , they helped build 262 houses in 47 villages of 2,460 people.
      </p>
      <p>
      The rate of the relocation has slowed. Some families opted out because they were
      expropriated of their land or have decent living conditions and secure jobs. “Some
      [families] are reluctant to return. There are no accompanying measures for them to restart
      income-generating activities. They don’t envision relocation.” The return strategy
      generally emanated from the government and NGOs, not from beneficiaries themselves. Also,
      the trauma caused by the conflict is vivid. Ismaila Sene explains how a “psychology of
      fear” has developed among many residents: “The conflict in Casamance contributed to
      restructure relational dynamics. Ancient practices of retaliation have created a
      psychology of fear. Trauma remains vivacious and residents avoid any debate.”
      </p>
      <h3>
      The Casamancais no longer identify with the message of their elders. Independence claims
      have grown unpopular and marginal.
      </h3>
      <p>
      Today, the conflict has relatively faded away. The majority of the MFDC leaders are worn
      out by years of an infructuous struggle. They are either old or have passed. The Casamance
      conflict has never stirred much interest beyond the confines of Senegal and its immediate
      neighbours. It has received little media coverage due, on one hand, to its low intensity.
      On the other hand, the Senegalese press has not been very present in Casamance. Until
      recently, the main media coverage of the region was from French news anchors. Senegalese
      writer and sociologist Dr El Hadj Souleymane Gassama explains this relative invisibility.
      Irredentist claims are marginal to young Casamancais who make 60% of residents. The
      conflict has become unpopular and is even rejected by a majority of Casamancais. And while
      some militants are still claiming independence, they don’t represent the dominant trend.
      </p>
      <p>
      Dr Gassama analyses the current state of the conflict: “It’s an unknown conflict of more
      than 30 years which is a long time span for a country. Conflicts which broke at the same
      period have now been jugulated. It’s a low-intensity conflict with sporadic atrocities,
      punctuated with long periods of calm and peace discussions. Now, the population has
      rejuvenated and is more diverse. Also, economic strains, instability in the sub-region and
      the trauma caused by abuses have worn out the Casamancais. Accordingly, the media coverage
      has been irregular, tainted with fake news, legends. The national pedagogy hasn’t been
      effective either in correcting these incoherences.”

      <h3>
      I conflated the many grievances of Casamance residents with ethnic belligerence, whereas
      the conflict was sparked and has been fed on social demands and an economic lethargy by
      design.
      </h3>
      <p>
      The Senegalese people have always had a curious relationship with Casamance. We have
      collectively rejected the idea of a division within the Senegalese territory. Public
      discussions on the conflict and on any social tension are tainted by the indivisible
      character of our territory and the untamed unity of our diverse cultural groups. Our
      republic’s slogan translates, <i>“one people, one aim, one spirit. ”</i> The media,
      religious leaders, celebrities have all exerted the art of coming together as one,
      silencing dissent and difference and magnifying Senegalese exceptionality. More often than
      not, attempts to discuss structural inequalities and injustice are hushed by our favorite
      motto, <i>“Senegal benn bopp la, ken munu ko xar ñaar. ”</i> The conflict in the south is
      evidence that we have not lived up to those ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
      Since 1982, we have agreed, in the press, in conversations, if only tacitly, on the term
      <i>“Casamance conflict.”</i> In so doing, we circumscribed the tension and the violence it
      stirred, in a geographical and cultural zone, singling out both the area and its
      residents. Like many who have never gone southwards, I thought Casamance was a monolith,
      limited to Ziguinchor. It illustrates the failure of successive political regimes to
      implement relevant social policies nationwide and envision a unified and cohesive solution
      to welfare issues.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lx8AFMM.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Fortunately, the people in Casamance have incessantly evoked their belonging to the
        Senegalese nation. The region has remained a vibrant cultural and commercial mix. Over the
        years, many families from different backgrounds have relocated. A young and strong
        workforce has moved to Dakar and other urban centres in search of economic opportunities,
        facilitating social mobility. Against all odds, merchants, who are mostly women, have
        maintained strong commercial exchanges. Via weekly buses, called “horaires,” they have
        travelled to fisheries in Kafountine and markets in Ziguinchor to stock seafood, fruit and
        palm oil which they would retail to domestic consumers in Dakar and other urban centres.
        Festivals, religious celebrations, initiation ceremonies like the Boukout in the sacred
        wood are opportunities for gathering and mutuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inauguration of the Farafegny Bridge in January 2019 in the Gambia offers relevant
        perspectives for the transportation of people and agricultural production. The bridge
        facilitates border transit and drastically alleviates the strain of the traditionally
        draining Dakar-Ziguinchor route. Now passengers can travel for five to six hours, instead
        of the 15-hour drive. These, among others, are reasons to hope for better days in the
        south.
      </p>
      <p>
        With her children and grandchildren, Stella continues to go to the Faroo and grow peanuts.
        Despite the stakes, relocating to Bouhouyou has been a good decision. “Fii mooma arranger,
        Ziguinchor faut que nga jënd matt, këregn. Mango sax ak madd booko bëggee da ngey jënd. ”
        [Mix of Wolof and French: Life is better here. In Ziguinchor, I always bought things like
        charcoal and wood. I even had to buy mangoes and madd (saba senegalensis)]. Life is
        simpler in Bouhouyou; her children go to a nearby school. When they want fruit, they
        literally just stretch a hand to pluck them from trees around. Even the fish they couldn’t
        afford comes handy. “Damey jënd si borom jën ñii juge Ziguinchor dem Guinee.” She buys it
        at a much lower price from Ziguinchor vendors who pass through Bouhouyou to sell fish
        across the border in Guinea.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the advantages of living near the border is that Stella no longer worries about the
        price of peanut seeds. Her nephews can cycle across the border to Guinea Bissau where it
        is cheaper. In Ziguinchor, a kilogramme of seeds costs 1,000 to 1,200 Francs (XOF) versus
        800 (Francs) in Sao Domingo, nearly 10 minutes ride from Bouhouyou.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stella still lives a life of hardship and struggles in that Banko (mud bricks) house she
        built with Jean de Dieu four years ago. His absence weighs hardly on her and the family as
        his untimely death deprived them of essential support and income. But for Stella, no time
        to mourn. She has worked hard her whole life, and she will continue to ensure that her
        younger children live decently.

At the house of Olawoyin Akinkunmi, politics was served on the table as dinner. He would
sit watching his parents argue about governance over a plate of amala and ewedu. At his
grandmother’s house in Alafara Oje, Ibadan, men would gather outside to drink beer and
discuss politics. AK Revo, would listen as each man analysed the condition of the country,
particularly Ibrahim Babangida’s transition programme. Military rule in Nigeria had taken
over all aspects of civilian life, down to the heady debates of secondary school students:
military rule is better than civilian rule. Students named their hostels on campuses in
accordance with the military fabric that covered the country: Army Base, Defence
Headquarters, Keep Off Military Zone.
</p>
<p>
The military had been in power for more than three decades. And even when power was to be
handed over to a civilian government in 1993, General Sani Abacha barked, “Abiola Retire
me? God forbid!” This sentiment was also shared by the Director of Military Intelligence,
Brigadier Halilu Akilu who said, “Abiola will be president over my dead body.”
</p>
<p>
Akinkunmi was 20 years old when he became the Students’ Union president of the Obafemi
Awolowo University in 2002. He was a small man with a loud voice. People called him AK
Revo, a short for Akin Revolution.
</p>
<p>
AK Revo noticed the discrepancies between what was taught theoretically in school and what
was happening in the Nigerian society. “In government you would hear about the separation
of power, independence of the judiciary. There was a complete disconnect between those
things we were learning and what was happening in the general society,” AK Revo said. His
peers often considered him too idealistic.
</p>
<p>
But it was the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election by General Ibrahim
Badamasi Babangida that sparked AK Revo’s activism and influenced his political outlook.
The ’93 elections, considered one of Nigeria’s most popular, was won by Moshood Kashimawo
Olawale Abiola who contested on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) against
the National Republic Convention (NRC) candidate, Bashir Tofa.
</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gkBvxJe.jpg" alt="" />
<p>
At the Ikeja City Mall, Lagos, AK Revo’s face lights up as he recalls the jingles and
slogans of Abiola’s party, “Hope 93.” We sit down amidst the crushing of coffee beans as
customers walk in and out of the shop. He had earlier called to inform me that he would be
running late for our meeting due to traffic. As he talks, I notice the traits of someone
who is accustomed to addressing crowds. At certain points he pauses, and we maintain eye
contact, neither of us looking away.
</p>
<p>
The SDP campaign jingle shows a dejected man lamenting the lack of food and other social
amenities.
<i>
  Na wa for this life o, na so so palaver/ I tire for this problem, I tire for life o/ My
  broda wetin you dey think o/ my sister help don come/ SDP, MKO, Kingibe/ Abiola na the
  logo/ SDP na the party/ to solve our problem and better our life o. MKO. MKO. MKO.
  Action. Progress.
</i>
</p>
<p>
The solution to these problems was to vote for Abiola and SDP—it was the same solution to
the same complaints Nigerians had in 2015 when they voted in the All Progressives Congress
(APC). <i>Vote Buhari. Vote Change.</i>
</p>
<p>
The annulment of the 1993 presidential elections led to protests around the country, and
AK Revo, a secondary school student at the time, participated.
</p>
<p>
This anger was also registered by four Nigerian teenagers: Richard Ajibola Ogunderu, Kabir
Adenuga, Benneth Oluwadaisi and Kenny Rasaq-Lawal who hijacked a Nigerian Airways A310
flight from Lagos to Abuja on October 25, 1993. They diverted the plane to Niamey, Niger
Republic. Among those on the flight was China’s Vice President Rong Yiren, Niger’s
transportation minister Souley Abdouleye and some Nigerian government officials. The only
demand of the hijackers was that M.K.O. Abiola be declared winner of the elections. The
hijackers had just completed secondary school. No one knew what their mission was until
Ogunderu declared during the hijack, “Ladies and gentlemen, this plane has been taken over
by the Movement for the Advancement of Democracy. Remain calm, we will not harm you.” The
four teenagers were later arrested and remanded in a Nigerien prison. Their brave act was
soon forgotten. In Nigeria, political bravery is not rewarded.
</p>
<h3>
But before 1993, another Nigerian had held an Ibadan radio station at gunpoint. His name:
Wole Soyinka.
</h3>
<p>
The date: October 15, 1965. The protest by Soyinka was against an equally flawed
democratic process which had brought in Chief Ladoke Akintola as the premier of the old
Western Region. At the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), Akinwande Oshin, the
continuity announcer, was to play Akintola’s victory speech at 7:14 p.m. He arrived at the
radio station at 6:45 p.m., holding both the English and Yoruba tapes. Lurking in the
shadows was a 31-year-old man who was described as tall, a little over 6 feet,
light-complexioned with luxuriant hair and shaved sideburns and moustache. Just as Oshin
was about to insert the Premier’s tape, he felt the cold nozzle of a Beretta pistol and a
voice that said, “Give me those tapes. Give me those tapes or else...” Instead of his
speech, Akintola heard, “Akintola, go! Drop your stolen mandate, leave town and take your
reprobates with you.”
</p>
<p>
Like Soyinka and the teenagers, AK Revo had a hunger for change. Right from secondary
school, he challenged “constituted authorities.” It was from his father that he heard
about the rule of law, separation of powers, fusion of powers, Montesquieu, and the
differences between the parliamentary and presidential systems of government.
</p>
<p>
His radicalism grew when he read Kwame Nkrumah’s <i>Towards Colonial Freedom</i> in his
father’s library. He describes the books that influenced him and mentions the dates they
were published. During our discussion, I notice that he hardly forgets names, dates or
events. He was barely 18 when he read Kenneth Kaunda’s <i>A Humanist in Africa</i> and
Lateef Jakande’s <i>The Trial of Obafemi Awolowo</i>. Before his brother was called-up for
the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), he brought home some books, and, in those books,
AK Revo found Friedrich Engels’ <i>What Is Communism?</i> It was this book that led to a
political divide between him and his father, and cemented his socialist outlook when he
was offered admission at the Obafemi Awolowo University to study accounting.

          Before the 20th century, before W.E.B. Du Bois declared the problem of that century as the
          problem of the colour line, before students formed the backbone of liberation movements in
          Africa and the diaspora, there were traditional chiefs, councils of elders, kings and
          queens who formed the vanguard of activism on the continent. Their first activism was
          against their own internal imperialism. The 16-year-long Kiriji War which happened during
          the fall of the Oyo Empire in present-day Nigeria is one example. Across the continent,
          many empires and kingdoms rose and fell based on their internal conflicts. New leadership
          was born out of protests against tyrant rulers or traditions. Activism had long existed
          here, even before Karl Marx was known. A result of these wars was domestic slavery.
          “African slavery was more flexible and benign,” Adam Hochschild wrote. Then the white man
          came; the Portuguese came to the Kingdom of Kongo. What started as trade between two equal
          kingdoms quickly degenerated into a fierce fight to conquer the African and take his land.
          Having discovered they could buy slaves, the Portuguese returned in large numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          “In 1500, only nine years after the first Europeans arrived Mbanzu Kongo, a Portuguese
          expedition was blown off course and came upon Brazil,” Hochschild recorded. This wind
          would blow more Africans away from their homes and form the Trans-Atlantic slave trade.
          Its first commodities of exports, young African men, women, and children. The history of
          white people’s contact with indigenous ethnic groups has always been catastrophic. The
          slaves were categorized according to their values. By the 1530s, more than 5,000 slaves
          were being shipped across the Atlantic every year. This number would triple by the 17th
          century. The wave of capitalism spilled into African kingdoms, and, for clothes and other
          material things, Europeans kidnapped Africans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The King of Kongo, King Affonso I, wrote to King Joao III of Portugal, “We need in this
          kingdom only priests and schoolteachers.” At another time, King Affonso wrote, “These
          goods exert such great attraction over simple and ignorant people that they believe in
          them and forget their belief in God.” At yet another time he wrote, “In this kingdom,
          faith is as fragile as glass because of the bad examples of the men who teach here.” These
          pleas went unheeded. By the end of the 1500s, the British, French, Dutch and Danes were
          scouring the continent for slaves. By then, it was too late for the Kingdom of Kongo to
          fight back. The ravaging of the continent had just begun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in East Africa, a prophet had seen the ravage coming like “a dreaded disease seeping
          through the pores of a healthy body and ravaging it beyond repair.” His name was Kimnyole
          Arap Turukat, the father of Koitalel Arap Samoei. He was a Nandi. The Nandi had conquered
          the ethnic groups around them. They were fierce and feared. When the Arab and Swahili
          traders showed arrogance, the Nandi destroyed their trade posts and killed the occupants.
          The Nandi also had wealth, and they had pride. A British anthropologist, Huntingford,
          observed that the Nandi thought of himself to be the equal if not the superior of the
          white man. What Kimnyole prophesied before his death was an iron snake that passed through
          Nandi land, belching smoke and fire. In 1895, just after the East Africa Protectorate had
          been declared, the Nandi Resistance began. It was led by Koitalel and lasted until 1906.
          The Nandi frustrated the construction of the railway line. They were one of the earliest
          ethnic groups to make use of guerrilla tactics.

          This form of resistance cut across the continent. African rulers protested the invasion of
          their lands and rights. In South Africa, the Xhosa and San fought the Boers and British in
          the Xhosa Wars in 1779, one of the longest wars in African colonial history. The Zulu
          fought the British Empire in 1879 in two major battles: the Battle of Isandlwana and the
          Battle of Ulundi. Those who couldn’t fight collaborated to survive. Some collaborated with
          the British to defeat their long-time enemies. For them, they did not see each other as
          Blacks or Africans, they saw each other solely as ethnic groups.

          As more slaves were taken to Brazil, Britain, the Caribbean and America, the oppression of
          Black people became internationalized and ratified. However, Africans continued to resist
          and fight for their freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1803, at Dunbar Creek on St. Simons Island in Georgia, a group of enslaved
          Africans—most of them Igbo—took over a ship and drowned themselves. In 1850, Harriet
          Tubman led enslaved Africans to freedom. Temitope Fagunwa, a pan-Africanist and historian,
          tells me he considers Koitalel an activist. “Whenever you demand a change in the status
          quo, that is activism. I consider the act of the Igbo landing mass suicide, activism. That
          act is an expression that says I would rather die, than be your commodity. It is like
          saying it is my life for the struggle.” All the activists I spoke with shared something in
          common—a commitment to the struggle. The struggle was not just a part of their life; it
          was their life.

          What members of the group could not influence on a national scale, they influenced on
          campus at the risk of expulsion or suspension by the university administration.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Obafemi Awolowo University is a bedrock of struggle and unionism in Nigeria. The
          school, formerly known as the University of Ife, formed in protest to the Ashby
          Commission, is in the quiet town of Ile-Ife, the cradle of Yoruba. The town lies one hour
          away from Ibadan and almost three hours from Lagos. In January 1999, this was where AK
          Revo decided to practice his “radical revolutionary wing of politics.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He was part of a socialist revolutionary organization on campus called Campaign for
          Workers and Youth Alternative that held meetings every Sunday evening. While Christian
          fellowships prayed and sang praises in their secretariats, this group of boys and girls in
          their teens and twenties discussed the political and economic situation of Nigeria. They
          analysed the poverty caused by the corruption of the leaders and debated on lines of
          action, usually with a press release they posted around campus with words like
          <i>“Fresh! Fresh! Fresh! Hot! Hot! Hot! Read Now!”</i> The press release at other times
          addressed events on campus such as lack of water or electricity, or it demanded that a
          suspended student activist be reinstated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes these meetings, which started with revolutionary songs, continued deep into the
          night with discussions on philosophy and economics. Each member marshalled their points
          and gave solutions to the country’s problems. As a socialist organization, it was their
          belief that Nigeria’s rot could only be stopped through a revolution. They called each
          other “Comrade.” To other students, these comrades were rabble-rousers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a different era, and in another country, these young men and women could have been part
          of Steve Biko’s South African Students’ Organisation. They could have been part of the
          African National Congress or its armed wing, <i>uMkhonto</i> we Sizwe, or they could have
          been part of the Mau Mau. They could also have been listening to the revolutionary voice
          of Amílcar Cabral, or shared the same room and platform with Kwame Nkrumah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often, a vibrant union existed because it had a leader who was a member of one of the
          socialist organisations. The members of these organisations did not just see themselves as
          students but as human rights defenders. They questioned the injustice in their immediate
          environment. And if, for example, one of the traders on campus sold a commodity for a cent
          more than it should be, they shut down the trader’s business and educated students on the
          evils of exploitation. If a lecturer assaulted a student, the Students’ Union took it up.
          The union lived up to the school anthem, “Aluta against all oppression.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The radical wing AK Revo joined was tested in his first year. When I asked him why he
          chose the radical wing, he said, “Almost everything in life changes. The most rational
          part of life is the part that recognizes that change is a constant thing. Choosing to join
          the radical wing is the most natural choice for a person who looks at society, who knows
          that he lives in an epoch of capitalism, who knows the horrors capitalism represents,
          especially in a backward new colony like ours. The desire to change things for the better
          took me to that wing.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not long after he joined one of the socialist groups on campus. The socialist
          organisations, many times not registered with the Division of Students Affairs, were often
          referred to as ideological groups. When AK Revo was in his first year, six of those
          organisations existed: Campaign for Workers and Youth Alternative (CWA), the Democratic
          Socialist Movement (DSM), the Pacesetters Movement (Pace), the Afrika Forward Movement
          (AFM), Movement for Social Justice (MSJ), and Congress of Progressive Youths (COPY). Among
          these organisations were those on the far left, the moderates and those considered to be
          on the right. In September of 1999, AK Revo joined the CWA. But something had happened
          prior to that.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was an ongoing protest against the outrageous hike in school fees from N590 to
          N4,500. The university administration reversed the fees due to the strike. This victory
          led to another demand: the reinstatement of 17 students who had been expelled from the
          university for their activism. They were known as the OAU 17, among them a medical
          student, Anthony Fashayo, also known as Tony Fash, who had been expelled in 1995. In
          March, a clamour for the students to be recalled to school began. Students marched from
          their halls of residence to the vice chancellor’s quarters. AK Revo held the banner
          demanding the reinstatement of the expelled students. The Student Union president, Lanre
          Legacy, termed the protest “Operation Total Paralysis,” where no lectures took place, no
          buses left the campus, and no one moved about. The whole focus was on getting the expelled
          students back to campus. A four-day lecture boycott was executed, and this forced the
          authorities to shut down the university.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to these protests, George Yemi Iwilade, known as Afrika, for his
          pan-Africanism—which he announced by dressing in traditional Yoruba attire—had led
          students to arrest some suspected cultists. Afrika was a brilliant young man who studied
          law and served as the secretary-general of the Student Union. The suspected cultists had
          dane-guns, and other dangerous weapons. They were said to be members of the Black Axe
          confraternity. They were paraded around campus before being handed over to the university
          management and the Nigeria Police. The protests for the OAU 17 led the Vice Chancellor,
          Professor Wale Omole, to invite mobile policemen who chased students out of campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1999, when Nigeria was going to host the Under-20 World Cup, the Student Union
          leadership threatened to disrupt the World Cup opening if the expelled students were not
          reinstated. After spending three months at home, the school reopened. However, student
          union activities were banned. This was one of the ways many university administrations
          across the country weakened activism on campuses. The students were also asked to write a
          letter of undertaking stating that they would be of good behaviour and not bring up the
          issue of reinstatement or anything else that would disrupt the academic year. This was a
          tactical move by university management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two weeks after resumption, a bigger problem started brewing. That night, the Kegites had
          a party; there was music and gyration and palm wine. OAU being the world headquarters of
          the Kegites Club always played host to students from other schools. During gyration,
          members of the Kegites Club would wear their attire, beat their drums, and dance all
          night. Afrika was a member of the Kegites Club. Many times, executives of the Student
          Union were also members of socialist organisations and the Kegites Club.
        </p>
        <p>
          As AK Revo spoke, his voice grew louder. “Two weeks after the opening of the campus was
          when the cultists struck.” He clapped his hands as if to signify the impact of what those
          cultists had done. A man buying coffee looked at us. The suspected cultists had been
          arraigned before a magistrate in March but were released for lack of evidence. When
          students returned in late June, the Student Union had informed the university of the
          presence of the suspected cultists on the campus and urged the school to act. Nothing was
          done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early morning, Saturday, July 10, cultists struck, killing five students. Yemi Iwilade,
          Eviano Ekelemu, Efe Epede, Yemi Ajiteru and Tunde Oke. The president of the Student Union,
          Lanre Adeleke a.k.a Legacy, escaped by a whisker. It was one of the worst moments anybody
          could have.
        </p>
        <p>
          AK Revo is stoic as he tells me about the night the cultists struck. Still, in his voice I
          can detect emotion. He lived in Awolowo Hall, the same hall of residence as Afrika. The
          Kegites gyration had taken place at the Awo Hall Café where students used to be served
          food until the Structural Adjustment Programme launched by the regime of General Ibrahim
          Babangida put an end to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I was woken by gunshots and the sound of people running helter-skelter as the guns
          boomed. The chaos lasted about 40 minutes before students regrouped. Legacy, encouraged by
          other activists, had to provide the necessary leadership to tell students to come out.” As
          if trying to remember that day, AK Revo speaks slowly. The students who had been shot or
          wounded were rushed to the health centre and the teaching hospital. Around 4 a.m. the
          number of those who had died were already known. AK Revo had at this time seen the body of
          Afrika. “It was in a very messy state. Very grotesque. He was macheted in the head. Axed
          in the head. Very gory sight,” he says in a mellow voice, trying not to dwell on the
          extreme details of that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          On campus, the story was always told about what happened on July 10, 1999. It was a
          reminder for our generation to never forget the price paid for the peace we enjoyed on
          campus. In the socialist organisations, this was one story that was told to every new
          member. The details given were gorier than what AK Revo told me. Afrika was held down to
          his mattress and literally butchered.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Every July 10, students wake up to the same pictures of Afrika posted on the notice boards
          around campus: Afrika wearing a Yoruba traditional wear, his hand raised in a black power
          salute; the other picture, Afrika’s corpse, bloodied.
        </h3>

        <p>
          The Student Union organizes several programmes during orientation week for new students
          immediately after the formal orientation by the university administration. This is done to
          counter the university’s effort to de-radicalize the new students. To accomplish this, the
          union hosts its former leaders and has them give speeches. In one of such programmes held
          at the Afrika Amphitheatre, a former speaker of the Students Representative Council,
          Destiny Adodo, took the mic and said, “How do you allow a victim of height called Michael
          Oluwaseun Faborode oppress you?” Students cheered. This was a bravery they had not seen.
          It was radicalism they admired but feared would get them expelled.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Anglo-Moz car park, a sound system is set up by 4 p.m. Drums are sounded, and a host of
          speakers are invited. The two halls of residence that host the first-year male and female
          students, Angola and Mozambique halls, were named in acknowledgment of the struggle for
          independence in both countries. The halls, by virtue of their names, are centers for
          training in radicalism. By 7 p.m. when students are back from class, the kegites gyrate
          around the bonfire. Two comrades, A.B. Nice and Comrade Olawale Ogunruku, whose admission
          was once revoked due to his activism, pick up the mic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the Greatest Ife.”
          <br></br>
          “Great!” “Articulate Ife!” “Articulate!”
          <br></br>
          “Ever conscious Ife!”
          <br></br>
          “Ever conscious!”
          <br></br>
          “Of the Greatest gbo gbo!” “Articulate gba gba!” “Gyration! Gyration! Gyration!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The drums beat into the night to a slow tempo. It is during this gyration that I
          understand why music and the struggle always go hand in hand. It is like a spirit descends
          on you. Ogunruku’s voice is like that of a seasoned activist whose blood has been injected
          with the pain of past injustices. A.B. Nice picks up from where Ogunruku stops. Other
          times, they sing together, their voices harmonizing intense, spirited and pained. After
          singing for a while, they introduce a dirge for Afrika, a call and response, and the crowd
          sings with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          AK Revo tells me that at 7 a.m. the next day, a congress was called at the amphitheatre. A
          security committee was formed, making it a standing committee of the Student Union. The
          amphitheatre, which is now known as Afrika Amphitheatre, is opposite the University Senate
          Building, as if standing in resistance to the university administration. A hunt for
          cultists, both inside and outside OAU and its environs, began. The express road was
          blocked to stop anyone from escaping. The bukateria was shut down and suspected cultists
          were arrested. That same day at 4 p.m. students came back together at the Afrika
          Amphitheatre to review the day’s activities. One of those arrested was Efosa Idahosa who
          gave details of the attack and how it was planned. At the behest of former President
          Olusegun Obasanjo, a panel of enquiry was set up at Afrika Amphitheatre and headed by
          Justice Okoi Itam. Justice was not served but the vice chancellor, Prof. Wale Omole, was
          suspended from office. Like many panels in Nigeria, which are set up to make the
          government look active, this was no different. A new acting Vice Chancellor, Prof. Roger
          Makanjuola, was appointed. It was at this public enquiry at Afrika Amphitheatre that AK
          Revo met with members of CWA and joined the organization in September 1999.

          In Nigeria, the student movement started in London with the formation of the West African
          Student Union (WASU) in 1925. The student movement later became a liberation movement. And
          when liberation was actualized, the student movement played the role of holding the newly
          elected African officials to account. WASU was formed to fight for the rights of students
          in London. African students faced racism, poor welfare conditions and had no way to
          channel their grievances. The issue of accommodation was especially crucial and WASU
          sought to solve it by creating “a home away from home” for the West African students
          there. J.B. Danquah became the first president of WASU while Ladipo Solanke was the
          secretary-general. What started as a union to address students’ welfare issues grew to
          address imperialism.
        </p>
        <p>
          By this time, the African National Congress (ANC) had existed for 13 years in South Africa
          with a mission to bring all Africans together to defend their rights and freedoms.

          The civil war had ended in America but the 1863 to 1877 Reconstruction era that was to
          deliver on equality was “overthrown.” Lands that were to be given to former slaves were
          not. Instead, Jim Crow laws were introduced. In Europe, a group of white men had gathered
          to divide Africa among themselves. Thus, the scramble and partitioning of Africa began.
          King Leopold II of Belgium paid to have Congo to himself. And America recognized and
          supported him. The civilization of the West was advancing on the back of Africans. A new
          imperialism was hitting the continent. The West started exploration companies in Africa
          which exploited Africans in the name of bringing civilization. Individual nations that had
          never interacted were united under one flag, one government, one name. And a new religion
          and a new language were given to them. This indignity, erroneously justified by white
          supremacy, led to a host of atrocities by Europeans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The continent experienced punitive actions ordered by the British, Portuguese, French,
          Italian, German, and Belgian armies. The Herero and Namaqua genocide by Germany, the
          genocide against the Congolese by Leopold II of Belgium, and the British concentration
          camps in Kenya were all part of the cruelty against Africans.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Congo, the brutality and disregard for Black life was rife in the rubber plantations,
          akin to what enslaved Africans faced in the cotton plantations of America. “In the Mongo
          language,” writes Adam Hochschild in his book King Leopold’s Ghost, “‘to send someone to
          harvest rubber’ is an idiom meaning ‘to tyrannize.’” An iconic image of tyranny by the
          Anglo-Belgian Indian Rubber Company is that of a man known as Nsala staring at the severed
          hand and foot of his five-year-old daughter Boali. This tyranny was hinged on economics:
          if it was not rubber plantations, it was cotton, sisal, or sugarcane plantations.The
          terror in Congo was recorded by an African American, William Sheppard, who showed the
          colonial brutality taking place.

          All over the world, the continued oppression of Africans was widespread. The only way this
          oppression could be addressed was through activism which at times resulted in armed
          struggle.
        </h3>
        <p>
          On June 30, 1960, when Congo gained independence, Belgium’s King Baudouin said in his
          speech, “The independence of the Congo is the result of the task conceived by the genius
          of King Leopold II.” The existence of Leopold II’s statues all over Belgium is a continued
          validation of this sentiment, in which Belgians pride themselves on, amongst many other
          things, coming to Congo “not as conquerors but as civilizers.” In the presence of King
          Baudouin, Lumumba retorted, “Morning, noon and night we were subjected to jeers, insults
          and blows because we were ‘Negroes.’ Who will ever forget that the black was addressed as
          ‘tu,’ not because he was a friend, but because the polite ‘vous’ was reserved for the
          white man? We have not forgotten that the law was never the same for the white and the
          black, that it was lenient to the one, and cruel and inhuman to the other.” Perhaps
          Lumumba’s defiant speech sealed his fate in the minds of Belgian officials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lumumba’s assassination shook Africa and the world. In the United Nations headquarters,
          African Americans, including the famed poet, Maya Angelou, interrupted the Security
          Council meeting with an angry protest. In London, over 4,000 protesters demonstrated in
          Trafalgar Square before marching to the Belgian embassy. In Belgrade, the capital of
          former Yugoslavia, an estimated crowd of 150,000 protested in front of the Belgian
          embassy, “a demonstration of disgust and anger.” The Belgian embassy was sacked.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/glzj9tL.jpg" alt="" />
        <h3>
          The death of Lumumba, whom African American freedom fighter Malcolm X called “the greatest
          Black man who ever walked the continent,” occurred when the politics of Black solidarity
          cut across continents.
        </h3>
        <p>
          What Lumumba represented to black people was a staunch Black leader who was not afraid to
          demand dignity. It is this pride in being a Black man that was equally found in Steve
          Biko, the South African activist who was killed in 1977 by the South African police. For
          Biko, his Black Consciousness Movement saw the urgent need for “the Black man to rally
          together around the cause of their oppression—the blackness of their skin.” In a South
          African Students’ Organisation (SASO) newsletter, Biko writes about the philosophy of
          Black Consciousness which he calls “an attitude of mind and a way of life.” It is why Biko
          says “the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed.”
          The question of freedom is the question of power. “No group, however benevolent, can ever
          hand power to the vanquished on a platter; the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the
          endurance of those whom they oppress,” said Biko.

          The man who turned to look at us when AK Revo clapped his hands had gone out. He came back
          and asked that we excuse him. He too had heard of the killing on July 10, 1999. He was not
          a student of OAU, but the gravity of what had happened affected him too. We chatted and he
          left.

          Why did liberation organisations adopt socialist ideologies? Was this the most efficient
          way to deal with the issues of colonialism and imperialism from western countries? WASU in
          no time started having links with communist organisations. It seemed like the only logical
          way to fight colonial imperialism was through a socialist and communist approach.
        </p>

          “We understood the limitations of student unionism. That being a student is a phase, not a
          status. That student unionism, no matter how strong it is, is not enough to change the
          society. You can influence, based on activism, some of the policies on campus, delay
          implementation. But at the opportune time, they will always introduce it. You can only get
          minimal concessions.” By “they” AK Revo is referring to the university administration,
          which is notorious for increasing tuition fees. The last protest I took part in was a
          protest against the increase of the acceptance fee from N2,000 to N20,000. The university
          management succeeded.

          In 1960, the radical left-leaning Nigerian Youth Congress (NYC) was founded. That same
          year, on November 19, the Nigerian Parliament passed the bill that would give the UK
          access to its airfields in Kano and Lagos, and its harbours in Lagos and Port Harcourt for
          the transportation of troops and supplies in peace or war time. The British, in an effort
          to control their former colonies, introduced a defence pact. On January 5, 1961, the
          official signing of the treaty took place.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, many Nigerian youths were not happy about this. In 1961, the NYC attended the All
          African People’s Conference that had in attendance Kenya’s Tom Mboya and Congo’s Patrice
          Lumumba. The organisation was led by Jeremiah Olatunji Otegbeye who, while in London
          studying medicine, was active in WASU. On February 15, 1961, Otegbeye led protests
          following the murder of Lumumba. He would lead another protest in 1962. Students from the
          University of Ibadan and some Nigerian politicians kicked against the Anglo-Nigerian
          Defence Pact. Part of the groups that protested was the National University of Nigerian
          Students (NUNS). The prime minister, Tafawa Balewa, had no option but to repeal the
          defence pact in January 1962. The involvement of Nigerian students in nationwide protests
          would continue to colour the political landscape of the country. In April 1978, one of the
          biggest protests ever to take place was organised by NUNS, and led by a student of the
          University of Lagos, Kolade Segun-Okeowo. The University of Lagos was the secretariat for
          NUNS. A 50 kobo increase in the daily meal of university students by the Federal Military
          Government during General Olusegun Obasanjo’s regime led to the “Ali Must Go” protests.
          The protests were named after the then Federal Commissioner for Education, Col. Ahmadu
          Adah Ali, who was said to be behind the increment from N1.50 to N2.00. Ali himself was a
          former secretary-general of NUNS. Not surprisingly, NUNS was a branch of WASU.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Zaria, at the Ahmadu Bello University; in Akoka, at the University of Lagos; and in
          Ile-Ife, at the University of Ife, students were killed by policemen and soldiers. NUNS
          was banned. And universities were shut down. A new organisation was formed, National
          Association of Nigerian Students (NANS). Fela Kuti would later sing about the massacre of
          these students in Beasts of No Nation, including the massacre of students in the Soweto
          Uprising of 1976 where school children were killed during peaceful protests against the
          imposition of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. Okeowo was expelled from the
          University of Lagos. The University of Ife offered him admission and he continued his
          studies, graduating two years later. The fee was however not reversed. The landscape of
          student unionism changed with NANS and the rule of General Ibrahim Babangida.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the rules of the ideological organisations was for qualified candidates to contest
          for the Students’ Representative Council. At the parliament, the socialist organisations
          won students over to their side by channelling pro-student arguments. The parliamentary
          sitting which could sometimes last all night was an avenue for students to build their
          oral skills. In his second year, AK Revo was voted into the parliament, representing the
          Faculty of Administration. This gave him a platform to establish himself on campus, both
          in the parliament and in congress. When he was entering his fourth year, his organization
          presented him as a candidate for the presidency of the union.
        </p>
        <p>
          The student unionism that OAU had created for itself was built on intellectual capability
          and militancy. AK Revo was already well known for being at the fore of demonstrations for
          students’ rights. He was the perfect person to contest for this office. He contested
          against five other candidates. As he recollects those moments, he smiles, then chuckles.
          “It was a movement!” The candidates bore aliases that reflected the leaders they admired,
          Marxist leaders like Karl Marx or Engels. Others bore names like Malcolm X. On their
          campaign posters they would post revolutionary quotes like Amílcar Cabral’s “Tell no lies,
          claim no easy victories, tell it to the people the way it is.” Elections came with
          manifestoes and door-to-door campaigns. Power brokering took place across faculties and
          with the University Joint Christian Mission (UJCM). For some, this was an opportunity to
          add something to their CV. For AK Revo and many from the socialist leaning organisations,
          there was a huge possibility that they would be suspended or expelled from school. It was
          a sacrifice they were ready for.

          WASU received support from the Communist Party of Great Britain for its activities towards
          clamouring for the independence of African countries. Kwame Nkrumah would go on to serve
          as the president of WASU. During the colonial era, Left parties showed support for the
          pro-independence movement. WASU’s prominence grew as it fought against discrimination in
          the UK. With many more Africans coming to the UK and US for studies, the relationship
          between the struggles in the diaspora and those on the African continent crossed each
          other.
        </p>
        <p>
          In October 1945, Kwame Nkrumah hosted the fifth Pan-African conference in Manchester. When
          the 1945 Congress took place, it attracted a lot of radical African activists. While some
          of these organisations took the political route to demand their rights, others took the
          armed struggle route. The Kenya Land and Freedom Army, which popularly became known as the
          Mau Mau, waged guerrilla war against the British colonial government and settlers. Some of
          the most brutal methods of violence, including the construction of concentration camps,
          were used in Kenya.

          Nigeria’s first general strike was on June 21, 1945. It was a strike that lasted for 45
          days and shook the colonial government. The strike started with the railway workers and
          spread to 16 other labour unions. An estimated 42,000 to 150,000 workers were involved,
          making it one of the largest strikes. The strike demand was for two shillings, six pence
          minimum wage and a 50% increase in the Cost of Living Allowance (COLA). The anti-colonial
          undertone of the strike put the colonial government in a tight position.
        </p>
        <p>
          America and the UK served as bases for the launch of many African activists and future
          presidents to demand independence. Across the continent, political parties were being
          formed and political prisoners were kept in isolation. Kenya’s Tom Mboya, who had earned
          his stripes as a trade unionist, was a prominent Pan-African figure in East Africa.
          Africans and people of African descent were fighting two evils on different continents.
          There was a synergy that cut across the continents. Each struggle was somehow linked to
          the other. In 1957, Ghana gained independence. What was more important about the
          independence celebrations was the presence of civil rights activists Martin Luther King,
          Jr., and his wife Coretta Scott King, Mordecai Johnson, Ralph Bunche, amongst others. At
          the reception, Dr King told Richard Nixon, the then American vice president, “I want you
          to come visit us down in Alabama where we are seeking the same kind of freedom the Gold
          Coast is celebrating.” The night Ghana’s flag was flown and the British Union Jack
          lowered, to the screams and shouts of almost half a million Ghanaians, Dr. King wept. “I
          was crying for joy. And I knew all about the struggles, and all of the pain, and all of
          the agony that these people had gone through for this moment,” he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          The independence of Ghana and the liberation movements in Africa ignited and fed the civil
          rights movement in America. A year after independence, Ghana hosted the All-African
          People’s Congress where Mboya was elected as chairman. The conference addressed
          independence movements and colonial rule. Mboya was just 28 years old. In this conference,
          Congo’s Patrice Lumumba, Zambia’s Kenneth Kaunda and a host of others were present. For
          Lumumba, this conference was a turning point in his activism against the Belgians. The
          solidarity between civil rights activists in America and activists on the continent was
          further shown in a rally in Washington in 1959, where Mboya and Dr. King spoke on the same
          podium. The 1950s and 1960s marked an important time in the history of Black people as
          they clamoured for freedom.

          As we talk, AK Revo recites his manifesto. It is difficult to find a student union leader
          who could still remember their manifesto two decades later. In student union elections,
          the poster plays a huge role in drawing voters in. AK Revo had no posters. The printer
          failed to deliver. But the lack of posters did not stop him from coasting to victory.
          Before the manifesto was the press night where the Association of Campus Journalists (ACJ)
          asked questions. The manifesto night always came with its own excitement. Supporters
          chanted names of their candidates. Candidates could not afford to be jittery. Over 5,000
          students were packed in the Afrika Amphitheatre. AK Revo was the last candidate to go to
          the podium. His name was on the lips of everyone. Under the Oduduwa Hall basement, he was
          surrounded by members of his organization as he made his way. “It was like the historic
          entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem,” he recalls. As he walked to the stage, some supporters
          tried to touch him, others started singing,
          <i>“Akin Revolution, the only way to fight oppression! Akin Revolution!”</i> The
          excitement could only be contained by him addressing the students. Due to his popularity,
          he was set to answer last.
        </p>
        <h3>
          AK Revo recalls that one of the presidential aspirants, while giving his manifesto, said,
          “All we need is a revolution.”
        </h3>
        <p>
          The students in turn pointed at AK Revo and shouted, “See him there.” There is a joy that
          comes with winning an election and in remembering events such as this. In having the
          support of students who believe in your cause. But with such support comes great
          responsibility. “It was like these guys had given me everything. I did not spend up to a
          thousand Naira of my own money. Students were the ones spending their money,” AK Revo
          said. He took that responsibility seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          After elections and swearing in, AK Revo started work. His first challenge was the lack of
          electricity for the previous five days on campus. His second task was combating the new
          policy from the university management that students would pay for the subscription of
          their own DSTV. This was close to the 2002 World Cup. “Within a week of our ascension to
          office, power was stable because they knew that a new sheriff was now in town. DSTV that
          was to be paid for remained free. We started with exploitation. The internet revolution
          was in Nigeria and cybercafes were charging N180 per hour. We first closed down the cafes
          and called for negotiations. Some of the owners of the cafes were professors. From N180 we
          settled at N100.” The owners of the cybercafes enjoyed more patronage and students could
          afford it. For the two weeks that the negotiations took place, the cybercafes remained
          shut.
        </p>
        <p>Yet, to some, he was considered an extremist.</p>
        <p>
          With every new challenge won, AK Revo went for another. His next challenge was fighting
          for allowance to be paid for the students’ industrial work experience scheme (SIWES). For
          the previous six years, students were not given their allowance. He went to Ibadan and met
          with the Industrial Training Fund, demanding the allowances to be paid. The university
          administration hit back by setting up a panel to deal with all those who partook in the
          demand for the allowances. “I made sure that N22,500 was given to the graduating students
          of the various faculties. 22,500 Naira 18 years ago was very huge money.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When I asked AK Revo what was happening to the money and why it was not getting to the
          students, he simply shrugged and said, “Maybe they were sitting on it, maybe they were
          diverting it. But a new Sheriff was in town!” That panel was not the first he would face.
          “I faced several panels for several things.” The boldness with which AK Revo executed his
          task was because he had nothing to hide, he tells me. He also had the support of his
          organization and students. “It was not about Akin!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) was led by Dr. Dipo Fasina, a lecturer at
          the Department of Philosophy. He was popularly known as Jingo and his reputation as an
          activist had preceded him. It was during his time as the ASUU president that an 11-month
          strike was embarked on nationwide. This extended AK Revo’s presidency for another full
          year, making him the only union president in OAU to be president for two years, from May
          2002 to March 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the new challenges he took up, AK Revo was bound to get the university administration
          angry. At the staff quarters, a student of Zoology department, Ogbona Eke, tried making an
          international call but instead got the voicemail. The owners of the store wanted him to
          pay. The student insisted he would not pay. The owner of the stores called the cracker
          team who were armed with Dane guns and shot Ogbona. The crackers were formed after the
          July 10 attack when students rejected the presence of the police on campus. It was under
          the direct control of the chairman of the security council. AK Revo was at the University
          of Ilorin helping the struggle there. Professor Adulrahman Oba had expelled students and
          sacked lecturers, leading to a national ASUU strike. On getting back to OAU, he found that
          the store had remained closed by students. Two months later, a request to open the store
          was sent to the Student Union. The response was that only a student congress could open
          the store. When word got out that the store had been opened, a bus was loaded from the
          Union building down to quarters. In the process, a mix-up happened, and some students went
          to the staff club. The president of the staff club claimed he was slapped by a student. AK
          Revo had to face a panel. The vice chancellor, Roger Makanjuola, was at that time planning
          to increase tuition fees, AK Revo had written to the headquarters of the banks not to
          accept payment of fees from OAU students. The university management, in attempting to
          weaken protests against the fee increment, had advised students to pay first before
          resumption. They then asked the new students to resume first before the old students
          joined two weeks later. This was a ploy to weaken opposition. By the second day of the
          protest, AK Revo was served with a suspension letter alongside three other students. His
          father got the news of his suspension through the radio.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a student is suspended, it is usually to serve as a deterrent to others to face their
          studies. AK Revo took the university to court and got an injunction restraining the
          university from executing the suspension. He resumed on campus. In 2004, he was expelled
          for his activism. Justice Chukwura Nnamani of the Federal High Court, Osogbo, granted him
          yet another injunction. He resumed on campus again, but AK Revo’s certificate was not
          released until 2007, four years after he graduated and was not mobilized for the NYSC.

        <h3>When you are convinced of what you are doing, it becomes easier to bear the burden.</h3>
        <p>
          “What kept me going was my conviction,” AK Revo tells me as we draw close to the end of
          our conversation. It was a huge burden academically, emotionally. We lost friends,
          girlfriends, CGPA, some opportunities and years. The strength of one’s conviction matters
          a lot. Also, I was never alone, students were always around.
        </p>
        <p>
          “We were armed with the ideas of Marxism. Knowing that it is not the political struggle
          that matters, but the application of the correct policies and tactics. It is not about us
          just wanting to protest. It is this understanding that makes me talk without regrets 18
          years after. If I were given another opportunity, I would avoid this or that mistake. But
          the main course of my life would remain the same. I would remain an irreconcilable
          socialist, a defender of the right of man, defender of students’ interest.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Many activists, former trade union leaders, who have led strikes and protests use their
          popularity to get into government and commit the same actions they protested against. What
          then makes one an activist? In Nigeria, South Africa and Zambia, there are examples of
          trade unionists who joined the government and changed. Zambia’s Frederick Chiluba, South
          Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa who still stands accused of the Marikana massacre, and Nigeria’s
          Adams Oshiomhole, who served as the governor of Edo State. “The term activist is too
          loose,” AK Revo tells me. He calls himself a revolutionary socialist. “An activist is
          anybody who just sees what is bad in the system and talks against it. Beyond the limits of
          activism is where we stand. The system cannot be reformed. We want to discard the system
          and, in its place, build another system based on the needs of the people, not the profit
          of the few.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As AK Revo and I part ways, he goes to his car. The attitude towards those who were in
          socialist organisations was that they would amount to nothing. For AK Revo who currently
          runs his business, things could have been better, but the sacrifice was worth it.

          Tonight, the room is packed to its maximum capacity, following guidelines set by
          Washington State’s Monroe Correctional Complex (MCC) to ensure the safety and security of
          the institution. Some sit on chairs arranged in a circle, while others stand outside for
          lack of space. If we had found a larger venue, we would have booked it, and the turnout
          would have been even greater, as these meetings—along with our classes and mentorship
          program—have become increasingly popular amongst the prisoners and the wider community.
          We’re the Latino Development Organization (LDO), a prisoner-led nonprofit operating in the
          trenches of America, and in order to understand what we do, allow me to introduce you to
          our founder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Francisco “Javier” Salazar-Sandoval was born in 1979, in the city of Tecomán in Colima,
          Mexico. When asked to speak a bit about his early years, he says, “Since I was young, my
          dad was in the military, so I always thought of him as somewhat of a superhero because he
          was out getting the bad guys.
        </p>
        <h3>When I was a kid, guns were normal to me, and I thought they were a good thing.</h3>
        <p>
          When I was ten years old, I was already comfortable enough to be carrying them for the
          older guys who didn’t want to do it themselves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Tecomán streets were controlled by gangsters who sold drugs and killed, and young boys
          were often in the mix. Before he was a teenager, Javier found himself pedalling substances
          and counterfeit cash, and when his parents moved him and his siblings to the United
          States, at 13, he had trouble relating to kids his own age.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I went to school for a little while, but I was still doing bad. In Mexico, where I grew
          up, the system is a little different, so when I came to the U.S., I was still hanging out
          with older guys who were dealing.” It was this lifestyle that found him, in 1998, at 18,
          in Lewis County Jail, facing possible imprisonment for illegal possession of a firearm. It
          was a two-count charge: one for illegal possession of a firearm, the other for possession
          of a firearm by an illegal alien.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/P4yK8FC.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          “It was like double jeopardy,” he claims, “because I was only arrested for one gun, yet
          they added the charge for possession by an alien, and it added another year to my
          sentence. I had always known immigrants were treated differently in this country, but I
          think that’s when it hit me the hardest.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He was found guilty and sent to the correctional centre on McNeal Island to serve a
          relatively short sentence. However, four days after his arrival, he was handcuffed, taken
          to segregation, and informed that he was under investigation for the killing of a man in
          Mason County. He spent the next nine months being transferred between the Mason County
          Jail and “the hole” (solitary confinement) on McNeal Island, until he was found guilty of
          first degree murder and given an overall sentence of 37 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Tonight</i>, Javier is among those standing around the outside of the circle. During
          our Sunday evening meetings, he usually watches quietly, as the announcer—whom he
          designated—introduces the various committees, and delivers updates pertaining to the
          program. A few times, though, he breaks his silence and speaks up to thank everybody who
          has shown support by coming to the event or by attending one of our classes, but most of
          the time he’s silent. Still, nobody has left any confusion about whom we look to for
          leadership. What they don’t know, however, is the chain of events that prompted him into
          taking steps to create an organization that offers educational opportunities to the
          incarcerated Latinx community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Javier’s story has, in some way, shown what Latin Americans experience in U.S. prisons.
          Prisoners convicted of murder in Washington are not eligible to be housed in a medium or
          minimum-security facility until they’ve first served four years in Closed Custody with
          good behaviour. Rather than being sent back to McNeal lsland, he was transferred to the
          notorious State Penitentiary in Walla Walla.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first things Latino prisoners learn is that, for us, solitude is not an option.
          Those not wishing to join a gang are considered weak. They are punished violently and
          ostracised. Some were gang-members prior to their incarceration. Those who were not, join
          a group known as the “Paisa Car.”
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QonaZCp.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Javier went against the grain from the day he stepped inside the confines of the 50-foot
          concrete wall that surrounds the facility. The Spanish word “paisa” translates to
          “countryman,” and is often used to refer to an undocumented Mexican in the U.S. However,
          not every member of the Paisa Car is undocumented, or necessarily Mexican. The
          prerequisite is that they’re of Latin descent, or heavily involved in—and ready to do
          anything for—the Latino community. Javier didn’t join, not because of fear, but out of a
          sense of obligation to reform what he perceived as injustices.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, “The people running the Car were tyrants, and taking advantage of other Paisas,
          so I rebelled against the leaders and soon others started following me.”
        </p>
        <p>One such leader was Tijuas, who challenged Javier to a knife fight in the yard.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          “I met him out there and the people took sides. Some were on my side and some were on his,
          and he was saying, ‘you know I’m bigger than you and older, and I’m gonna stab and kill
          you,’ but the whole time I was calm. He was in his emotions, but I wasn’t. It didn’t
          matter if I got stabbed because the only other option was to not be a man and stand up for
          what I believed in. To me that wasn’t an option. So when the people saw that I was a man
          and he was a coward, they started coming over to my side and within my first month there,
          I started calling the shots.” Once formalities have been attended to, the announcer
          informs us that our facilitator has something to share, and the room falls silent as every
          eye stares up attentively. After a brief pause, Javier begins, “I just want to thank
          everyone who continues to show support for the LDO, and to thank our outside sponsors as
          well. I’d also like to give you an update about everything we’re doing. The Spanish class
          is going well every Saturday night. A lot of people want to get into it, but there’s still
          a long waiting list, so if you sign up, please make sure you’re serious.
        </p>
        <h3>The mentorship program is still growing, but there’s always room for more</h3>
        <p>
          , so if you think you’d make a good mentor, or want to be mentored by someone else, get in
          touch with one of the committee members and find out how you can become involved.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He talks about
          <i>
            the Plaza Comunitaria. According to the Latino Development Organization archives, the
            Plaza Comunitaria, in collaboration with the Mexican Government, provides a certificate
            equivalent to a GED for participants who will be deported upon release to a Latin
            American country, and will enable us to create a pathway to success for students who are
            not citizens of the United States
          </i>
          . Javier tells us it’s coming soon, that not only will ours be the sixth Plaza in the
          state, but the only one operating within a Washington prison.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/8VcptNr.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          After he gained the respect of the Paisas in Walla Walla, Javier began moving from prison
          to prison, using his natural charisma to reform the Car wherever he went. In 2008, he was
          in the Clallam Bay Correction Center, and another Latino group, La F.U.M.A. (Familia Unida
          Mexicano Azteca – [United Mexican Aztec Family]), didn’t want him to treat the people
          fairly, because it prevented them from profiting from extortion. A war commenced that
          would ultimately lead to multiple stabbings on both sides statewide, including one in
          which Javier was the target. Some, seeing an opportunity to acquire followers and reclaim
          control of the Paisa Car, offered protection to members of La F.U.M.A. who were willing to
          remove their gang tattoos. Things, however, got bloodier and more serious when, in Walla
          Walla, a member of the La F.U.M.A. slit the throat of a member of the Paisa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Javier says, “I was trying to get moved there to fix things before something like that
          happened, but I couldn’t get to that unit in time.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Once he found out what had happened, word went out to every member of the Paisa Car in
          Washington State: FUMAs are not welcome in the population. To date, the Department of
          Corrections’ Internal Investigations agents separate the two groups, only placing members
          of La F.U.M.A. where there are no Paisas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Few in this room know what Javier has gone through over the past 22 years to provide them
          what luxury he can in such a bleak environment, nor do they grasp the depth of the work
          taking place by the LDO. What most of them know is that our Arts and Lectures Series
          begins in a few minutes, and they’ll be given a lesson in science from a prominent
          teacher, while the Latino Advisory Board (LAB) meets in another room with the Board of
          Directors. LDO literature defines the LAB
          <i>
            as a collective of incarcerated LDO representatives, responsible for advising the Board
            of Directors on decisions pertaining to the organization.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>***</p>
        <h3>
          In 2017, I was incarcerated in the Monroe Correctional Complex, under Francisco “Javier”
          Salazar-Sandoval’s leadership, and for the first time during my prison experience, decided
          to make positive changes in my life.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I became involved with a prisoner-led nonprofit organization offering liberal arts degrees
          to incarcerated students. To help them raise funding, I learned how to write grants. It
          was during my time with them that Javier approached me with his vision. He asked if I
          could apply what I’d learned to help him create an educational organization. And though I
          believed I had, in fact, acquired a thorough enough understanding of organizational
          development to structure a nonprofit, I had a question for him as well:
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/o0Nh62U.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          “There’s already an educational program here, so what need would we be filling if we
          created another one?”
        </p>
        <p>
          As it turns out, Latino people make up 14% of Washington’s incarcerated population, yet
          only 4% of the other organization’s student body. Moreover, of the classes offered in MCC,
          none was being taught in Spanish, or of much value to people being deported upon release.
          This was most disturbing when I learned that even the Washington State Department of
          Corrections’ website claimed that Latinx people were 17% more likely to participate in
          educational programing while incarcerated than their white counterparts, yet the prison
          administration considered the education of immigrant prisoners of little importance,
          putting them on the end of long waiting lists for classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first suggestion was, “Let’s not get too hasty in creating a whole new organization.
          Why don’t we ask the other one for help first?” Having written grant proposals for them, I
          felt confident that the model they showed to funders was one of <i>education to all</i>.
          But after several sit-downs with the other organization, during which we proposed that
          they bring the Plaza Comunitaria into MCC, it became clear they were too busy providing
          their services to Americans, and like DOC, considered the education of brown people a
          matter of low priority.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I ask Javier why this is important to him, he says, “DOC is failing in their job to
          reform the incarcerated population, and Latinos are the most affected by this because of
          the language barrier. I’ve been fighting for justice and equality for our people for 22
          years, and I think undocumented people deserve the same opportunity to succeed as everyone
          else.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The LAB sits around a table with our Board of Directors because Javier is right, and
          anybody not blinded by a bias against Latino people can see it. They tell us they had a
          meeting last week with the Mexican Consulate, and the contract to bring in the
        </p>
        <p>
          Plaza has finally been signed. They inform us that we now have an office in the city of
          Monroe, where they can handle administrative tasks. They let us know that they’re working
          with the prison to book another classroom for our mentorship program. The LAB says we
          decided that we need to create a newsletter and a mailing list to keep our volunteers and
          supporters informed on what’s going on. They take note and reply that they’ll find out
          what steps need to be taken to get this approved by the prison.
        </p>
        <p>
          After our final meeting with the other organization, I went to my cell and began to draw
          up a plan of action. The next time I saw Javier, I told him he would need to form an
          advisory board, consisting of incarcerated Latinos in order to assure the program didn’t
          get hijacked by outsiders who saw potential for grant money, yet didn’t understand the
          unique needs of our community. He already had a team which helped him make decisions
          pertaining to the prison’s 70-year-old Hispanic Culture Group, so he simply added me with
          the job of bringing his vision to life.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aRmxWlL.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Next we developed committees, which would tackle the specific tasks associated with
          running an educational organization inside a prison. However, understanding there would be
          footwork that we couldn’t do because of our obvious restrictions, we recruited outside
          help, collaborating with Hispanic Culture Group volunteers. During an HCG meeting the name
          Latino Development Organization was coined with the help of the population, and, soon
          after, our team became the Latino Advisory Board. Within the first year, the Latino
          Mentorship Project (LaMP), in which prisoners mentor one another in various topics, was up
          and running, along with multiracial, inclusive classes that were so popular among the
          incarcerated that they had long waiting lists. It was around this time that the other
          organization decided they no longer required my assistance in fundraising. I
          tried—unsuccessfully—for months to get a meeting with their director (an employee from the
          outside, who works in the prison). Then one day I caught him in the hall and asked what
          the issue was.
        </p>
        <p>
          He said, “We taught you these skills so you could help us, and as soon as you became
          competent with them, you turned around and formed another organization. There aren’t even
          enough rooms in this building for all the classes we want to offer, and now we're
          competing with the LDO for them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn’t help but suspect that when he uttered the word “rooms,” what he really meant
          was “funding.” But rather than pointing this out, I said, “Listen, we’ve been asking you
          for the past year to make your program equitable, and extend opportunities to the Latino
          community as well. We even told you how you could do it, and offered to help. You guys
          didn’t want to do it, even though you love to put on your grant applications that you
          support us, so we had to do it ourselves.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually the entire LAB was called in for a meeting with the other organization, during
          which they attempted to ascertain as much information as possible about where the LDO was
          headed. By this time, however, we had been informed of their agenda to try and stop us.
          Without our knowledge, they held a similar sit-down with our outside volunteers. When
          asked how Javier feels about all the opposition we encountered early on, he says, “It
          wasn’t just them. The prison was against us too. They didn’t believe in Latinos because
          we’re known to be gangsters, so they were making it hard for us to get together. They
          closed our meetings a couple times because they thought we were doing illegal things in
          there. They thought we weren’t a legitimate group, so they kept us from getting resources
          that other groups had. Even our volunteers didn’t believe in us at first.”

          <i>Tonight</i>, some of the same volunteers who, a little over two years ago, seemed to
          think what we were proposing was cute, sit on the Board of Directors of a 501(c)3 which
          was conceptualized and structured by people from one of the most marginalized groups in
          the country. The LDO continues to be run by the community it serves, with the guidance of
          a visionary who’s shed his own blood for its mission,
          <i>
            to promote equity by assuring opportunities and resources, such as education, are
            accessible to all.
          </i>

          We pushed, but we didn’t buck against the system. When the prison power structure—and the
          other organization—seemed against us, we asked nicely how we could continue to balance the
          scale for brown people without needlessly offending. We made our mission statement central
          to all movement within the LDO, and Javier insisted he only hold his position until he was
          voted out. Our by-laws define the facilitator as one who
          <i>
            is entrusted to assure the LDO’s mission is upheld, and for this reason, has veto power
            during voting. Because the facilitator is voted in by the LAB, he or she can also be
            voted out for any reason decided appropriate by the majority of the LAB.

          <i>Tonight</i>, I ask Javier where he sees the LDO in five years, and he replies,
          “Continuing to provide education and skills to Latinos that we can use in our own
          countries. We plan to keep assisting with re-entry for people being deported—whether it’s
          finding them a job, or helping with housing—so they have the same chance as anyone else.
          We’ll extend our mentorship program into local youth centres, so hopefully we can keep
          teenagers off the destructive paths that led most of us here. Really, the LDO is all about
          preparing people mentally and psychologically for success.”
